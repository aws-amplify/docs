          @{{author}}, since a file was deleted from the `src/pages` and/or `src/fragments` directories, redirects might need to be set up so these previous pages do not 404. If redirects are needed, please answer these questions for each redirect that is needed:

          - What is the source address of the redirect? (Where are you trying to redirect from?)

          - What is the target address of the redirect? (Where are you trying to redirect to?)

          - Type of redirect? 301 - permanent redirect or 302 - temporary redirect? (More info on Amplify Hosting redirects here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redirects.html)
