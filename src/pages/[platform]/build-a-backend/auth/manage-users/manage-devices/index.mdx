Amplify Auth enables you to track devices your users use for auditing, MFA, and more. Before you begin it is important to understand the terminology for device statuses:

- **Tracked:** Every time the user signs in with a new device, the client is given the device key at the end of a successful authentication event. We use this device key to generate a salt and password verifier which is used to call the ConfirmDevice API. At this point, the device is considered to be _tracked_. Once the device is in a tracked state, you can use the Amazon Cognito console to see the time it started to be tracked, last authentication time, and other information about that device.
- **Remembered:** Remembered devices are also tracked. During user authentication, the device key and secret pair assigned to a remembered device is used to authenticate the device to verify that it is the same device that the user previously used to sign in.
- **Not Remembered:** A not-remembered device is a tracked device where Cognito has been configured to require users to "Opt-in" to remember a device, but the user has not opt-ed in to having the device remembered. This use case is used for users signing into their application from a device that they don't own.
- **Forgotten:** a forgotten device is one removed from being remembered

<Callout info>

**Note:** [device tracking and remembering](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/tracking-and-remembering-devices-using-amazon-cognito-your-user-pools/) features are not available when using federating sign-in with external providers as devices are tracked on the upstream identity provider. These features are also not available when using Cognito's Hosted UI.

## Remember devices

You can remember devices using the following:

## Fetch the current device

You can fetch the current device by using the following:

```dart
Future<void> fetchCurrentUserDevice() async {
  try {
    final device = await Amplify.Auth.fetchCurrentDevice();
    safePrint('Device: $device');
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Get current device failed with error: $e');
  }
}
```

</InlineFilter>

You can now set up devices to be remembered, forgotten, and fetched.
