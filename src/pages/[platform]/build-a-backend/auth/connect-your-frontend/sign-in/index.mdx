Amplify provides a client library that enables you to interact with backend resources such as Amplify Auth.

<InlineFilter filters={["react"]}>
<Callout info>

The quickest way to get started with Amplify Auth in your frontend application is with the [Authenticator component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator), which provides a customizable UI and complete authentication flows.

## Using the signIn API

{/* signIn api definition */}

<InlineFilter filters={["angular", "javascript", "nextjs", "react", "react-native", "vue"]}>

```ts
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth'

await signIn({
  username: "hello@mycompany.com",
  password: "hunter2",
})
```

</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={["flutter"]}>

```dart
Future<void> signInUser(String username, String password) async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
      username: username,
      password: password,
    );
    await _handleSignInResult(result);
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Error signing in: ${e.message}');
  }
}
```

Depending on your configuration and how the user signed up, one or more confirmations will be necessary. Use the `SignInResult` returned from `Amplify.Auth.signIn` to check the next step for signing in. When the value is `done`, the user has successfully signed in.

```dart
Future<void> _handleSignInResult(SignInResult result) async {
  switch (result.nextStep.signInStep) {
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithSmsMfaCode:
      final codeDeliveryDetails = result.nextStep.codeDeliveryDetails!;
      _handleCodeDelivery(codeDeliveryDetails);
      break;
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithNewPassword:
      safePrint('Enter a new password to continue signing in');
      break;
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithCustomChallenge:
      final parameters = result.nextStep.additionalInfo;
      final prompt = parameters['prompt']!;
      safePrint(prompt);
      break;
    case AuthSignInStep.resetPassword:
      final resetResult = await Amplify.Auth.resetPassword(
        username: username,
      );
      await _handleResetPasswordResult(resetResult);
      break;
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignUp:
      // Resend the sign up code to the registered device.
      final resendResult = await Amplify.Auth.resendSignUpCode(
        username: username,
      );
      _handleCodeDelivery(resendResult.codeDeliveryDetails);
      break;
    case AuthSignInStep.done:
      safePrint('Sign in is complete');
      break;
  }
}

void _handleCodeDelivery(AuthCodeDeliveryDetails codeDeliveryDetails) {
  safePrint(
    'A confirmation code has been sent to ${codeDeliveryDetails.destination}. '

{/* with multi-factor auth */}
## With multi-factor auth enabled

When you have Email or SMS MFA enabled, Cognito will send messages to your users on your behalf. Email and SMS messages require that your users have email address and phone number attributes respectively. It is recommended to set these attributes as required in your user pool if you wish to use either Email MFA or SMS MFA. When these attributes are required, a user must provide these details before they can complete the sign up process.

If you have set MFA to be required and you have activated more than one authentication factor, Cognito will prompt new users to select an MFA factor they want to use. Users must have a phone number to select SMS and an email address to select email MFA.

If a user doesn't have the necessary attributes defined for any available message based MFA, Cognito will prompt them to set up TOTP.

Visit the [multi-factor authentication documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/concepts/multi-factor-authentication/) to learn more about enabling MFA on your backend auth resource.

**Note:** you must call `confirmSignIn` in the same app session as you call `signIn`. If you close the app, you will need to call `signIn` again. As a result, for testing purposes, you'll at least need an input field where you can enter the code sent via SMS and pass it to `confirmSignIn`.

## Sign in with an external identity provider

To sign in using an external identity provider such as Google, use the `signInWithRedirect` function.

<InlineFilter filters={["angular", "javascript", "nextjs", "react", "react-native", "vue"]}>

```ts
import { signInWithRedirect } from "aws-amplify/auth"

signInWithRedirect({ provider: "Google" })
```

<Callout info>

**Note:** if you do not pass an argument to `signInWithRedirect` it will redirect your users to the [Cognito Hosted UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-app-integration.html), which has limited support for customization.

</Callout>

Alternatively if you have configured OIDC or SAML-based identity providers in your auth resource, you can specify a "custom" provider in `signInWithRedirect`:


```ts
import { signInWithRedirect } from "aws-amplify/auth"

signInWithRedirect({ provider: {
  custom: "MyOidcProvider"
}})
```

### Auto sign-in

The `autoSignIn` API will automatically sign-in a user when it was previously enabled by the `signUp` API and after any of the following cases has completed:

- User confirmed their account with a verification code sent to their phone or email (default option).
- User confirmed their account with a verification link sent to their phone or email. In order to enable this option you need to go to the [Amazon Cognito console](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/cognito), look for your userpool, then go to the `Messaging` tab and enable `link` mode inside the `Verification message` option. Finally you need to define the `signUpVerificationMethod` to `link` inside the `Cognito` option of your `Auth` config.

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { autoSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

await autoSignIn();
```

</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>

### Install native module

`signInWithRedirect` displays the sign-in UI inside a platform-dependent webview. On iOS devices, an [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession) will be launched and, on Android, a [Custom Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/). After the sign-in process is complete, the sign-in UI will redirect back to your app.

To enable this capability, an additional dependency must be installed.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm add @aws-amplify/rtn-web-browser
```

### Platform Setup

On iOS, there are no additional setup steps.

#### Android

After a successful sign-in, the sign-in UI will attempt to redirect back to your application. To register the redirect URI scheme you configured above with the device, an `intent-filter` must be added to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file which should be located in your React Native app's `android/app/src/main` directory.

Add the `intent-filter` to your application's main activity, replacing `myapp` with your redirect URI scheme as necessary.

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<application ...>
    <activity android:name=".MainActivity" ...>
        ...
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
            <data android:scheme="myapp" />
        </intent-filter>
        ...
    </activity>
</application>
```

</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
### How It Works

Sign-in with web UI will display the sign-in UI inside a webview. After the sign-in process is complete, the sign-in UI will redirect back to your app.

### Platform Setup

#### Web

To use Hosted UI in your Flutter web application locally, you must run the app with the `--web-port=3000` argument (with the value being whichever port you assigned to localhost host when configuring your redirect URIs).

#### Android

Add the following `queries` element to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in your app's `android/app/src/main` directory, as well as the following `intent-filter` to the `MainActivity` in the same file.

Replace `myapp` with your redirect URI scheme as necessary:

```xml
<queries>
    <intent>
        <action android:name=
            "android.support.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService" />
    </intent>
</queries>
<application>
  ...
  <activity
        android:name=".MainActivity" android:exported="true">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
            <data android:scheme="myapp" />
        </intent-filter>
  </activity>
  ...
</application>
```

#### macOS

Open XCode and enable the App Sandbox capability and then select "Incoming Connections (Server)" under "Network".

![Incoming Connections setting selected in the App Sandbox section of the runner signing and capabilities tab.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/xcode-entitlements.png)

#### iOS, Windows and Linux

No specific platform configuration is required.

### Launch Social Web UI Sign In

You're now ready to launch sign in with your external provider's web UI.

```dart
Future<void> socialSignIn() async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Auth.signInWithWebUI(
      provider: AuthProvider.google,
    );
    safePrint('Sign in result: $result');
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Error signing in: ${e.message}');
  }
}
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
## Update AndroidManifest.xml

Add the following activity and queries tag to your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file, replacing `myapp` with
your redirect URI prefix if necessary:

```xml
<application ...>
  ...
  <activity
      android:name="com.amplifyframework.auth.cognito.activities.HostedUIRedirectActivity"
      android:exported="true">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
          <data android:scheme="myapp" />
      </intent-filter>
  </activity>
  ...
</application>
```

## Launch Social Web UI Sign In

<Block name="Java">

```java
// Replace facebook with your chosen auth provider such as google, amazon, or apple

## Update Info.plist

Sign-in with web UI requires the Amplify plugin to show up the sign-in UI inside a webview. After the sign-in process is complete it will redirect back to your app. 
You have to enable this in your app's `Info.plist`. Right click Info.plist and then choose Open As > Source Code. Add the following entry in the URL scheme:

```xml

 <plist version="1.0">

     <dict>
     <!-- YOUR OTHER PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->

     <!-- ADD AN ENTRY TO CFBundleURLTypes for Cognito Auth -->
     <!-- IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CFBundleURLTypes, YOU CAN COPY THE WHOLE BLOCK BELOW -->
     <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
     <array>
         <dict>
             <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
             <array>
                 <string>myapp</string>
             </array>
         </dict>
     </array>

     <!-- ... -->
     </dict>
```

When creating a new SwiftUI app using Xcode 13 no longer require configuration files such as the Info.plist. If you are missing this file, click on the project target, under Info, Url Types, and click '+' to add a new URL Type. Add `myapp` to the URL Schemes. You should see the Info.plist file now with the entry for CFBundleURLSchemes.
