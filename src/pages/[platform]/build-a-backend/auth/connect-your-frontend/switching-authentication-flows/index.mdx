`AWSCognitoAuthPlugin` allows you to switch between different auth flows while initiating signIn. You can configure the flow in the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file or pass the `authFlowType` as a runtime parameter to the `signIn` api call.

For client side authentication there are four different flows that can be configured during runtime:

1. `userSRP`: The `userSRP` flow uses the [SRP protocol (Secure Remote Password)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol) where the password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server. This is the recommended flow and is used by default.

2. `userPassword`: The `userPassword` flow will send user credentials unencrypted to the back-end. If you want to migrate users to Cognito using the "Migration" trigger and avoid forcing users to reset their passwords, you will need to use this authentication type because the Lambda function invoked by the trigger needs to verify the supplied credentials.

3. `customWithSRP`: The `customWithSRP` flow is used to start with SRP authentication and then switch to custom authentication. This is useful if you want to use SRP for the initial authentication and then use custom authentication for subsequent authentication attempts.

4. `customWithoutSRP`: The `customWithoutSRP` flow is used to start authentication flow **WITHOUT** SRP and then use a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements.

5. `userAuth`: The `userAuth` flow is a choice-based authentication flow that allows the user to choose from the list of available authentication methods. This flow is useful when you want to provide the user with the option to choose the authentication method. The choices that may be available to the user are `emailOTP`, `smsOTP`, `webAuthn`, `password` or `passwordSRP`.

`Auth` can be configured to use the different flows at runtime by calling `signIn` with `AuthSignInOptions`'s `authFlowType` as `AuthFlowType.userPassword`, `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithoutSrp` or `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithSrp`. If you do not specify the `AuthFlowType` in `AuthSignInOptions`, the default flow (`AuthFlowType.userSRP`) will be used.

Runtime configuration will take precedence and will override any auth flow type configuration present in amplify_outputs.json

## USER_AUTH (Choice-based authentication) flow

A use case for the `USER_AUTH` authentication flow is to provide the user with the option to choose the authentication method. The choices that may be available to the user are `emailOTP`, `smsOTP`, `webAuthn`, `password` or `passwordSRP`.

```swift
let pluginOptions = AWSAuthSignInOptions(
    authFlowType: .userAuth)
let signInResult = try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
    username: username,
    password: password,
    options: .init(pluginOptions: pluginOptions))
guard case .continueSignInWithFirstFactorSelection(let availableFactors) = signInResult.nextStep else {
    return
}
print("Available factors: \(availableFactors)")
```

The selection of the authentication method is done by the user. The user can choose from the available factors and proceed with the selected factor. You should call the `confirmSignIn` API with the selected factor to continue the sign-in process. Following is an example if you want to proceed with the `emailOTP` factor selection:

```swift
// Select emailOTP as the factor
var confirmSignInResult = try await Amplify.Auth.confirmSignIn(
    challengeResponse: AuthFactorType.emailOTP.challengeResponse)
```

## USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow

A use case for the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow is migrating users into Amazon Cognito

A user migration Lambda trigger helps migrate users from a legacy user management system into your user pool. If you choose the USER_PASSWORD_AUTH authentication flow, users don't have to reset their passwords during user migration. This flow sends your user's password to the service over an encrypted SSL connection during authentication.

When you have migrated all your users, switch flows to the more secure SRP flow. The SRP flow doesn't send any passwords over the network.

```swift
func signIn(username: String, password: String) async throws {

    let option = AWSAuthSignInOptions(authFlowType: .userPassword)
    do {
        let result = try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
            username: username,
            password: password,
            options: AuthSignInRequest.Options(pluginOptions: option))
        print("Sign in succeeded with result: \(result)")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to sign in with error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### Set up auth backend

In order to use the authentication flow `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, your Cognito app client has to be configured to allow it. Amplify Gen 2 enables SRP auth by default. To enable USER_PASSWORD_AUTH, you can update the `backend.ts` file with the following changes:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend'
import { auth } from './auth/resource'
import { data } from './data/resource'

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data,
});

// highlight-start
backend.auth.resources.cfnResources.cfnUserPoolClient.explicitAuthFlows = [
  "ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH",
  "ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH",
  "ALLOW_USER_AUTH",
  "ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH"
];
// highlight-end
```

### Migrate users with Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides a trigger to migrate users from your existing user directory seamlessly into Cognito. You achieve this by configuring your User Pool's "Migration" trigger which invokes a Lambda function whenever a user that does not already exist in the user pool authenticates, or resets their password.

In short, the Lambda function will validate the user credentials against your existing user directory and return a response object containing the user attributes and status on success. An error message will be returned if an error occurs. There's documentation around [how to set up this migration flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html) and more detailed instructions on [how the lambda should handle request and response objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-migrate-user.html#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-user-migration).

## CUSTOM_AUTH flow

Amazon Cognito User Pools supports customizing the authentication flow to enable custom challenge types, in addition to a password in order to verify the identity of users. The custom authentication flow is a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements. These challenge types may include CAPTCHAs or dynamic challenge questions.

To define your challenges for custom authentication flow, you need to implement three Lambda triggers for Amazon Cognito.

The flow is initiated by calling `signIn` with `AuthSignInOptions` configured with `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithSrp` OR `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithoutSrp`.

Follow the instructions in [Custom Auth Sign In](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/sign-in-custom-flow/) to learn about how to integrate custom authentication flow in your application with the Auth APIs.

For client side authentication there are four different flows:

1. `USER_SRP_AUTH`: The `USER_SRP_AUTH` flow uses the [SRP protocol (Secure Remote Password)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol) where the password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server. This is the recommended flow and is used by default.

2. `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: The `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow will send user credentials to the backend without applying SRP encryption. If you want to migrate users to Cognito using the "Migration" trigger and avoid forcing users to reset their passwords, you will need to use this authentication type because the Lambda function invoked by the trigger needs to verify the supplied credentials.

3. `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` & `CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP`: Allows for a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements.

4. `USER_AUTH`: The `USER_AUTH` flow is a choice-based authentication flow that allows the user to choose from the list of available authentication methods. This flow is useful when you want to provide the user with the option to choose the authentication method. The choices that may be available to the user are `EMAIL_OTP`, `SMS_OTP`, `WEB_AUTHN`, `PASSWORD` or `PASSWORD_SRP`.

The Auth flow can be customized when calling `signIn`, for example:

```ts title="src/main.ts"
await signIn({
  username: "hello@mycompany.com",
  password: "hunter2",
  options: {
      authFlowType: 'USER_AUTH'
  }
})
```

> For more information about authentication flows, please visit [AWS Cognito developer documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/amazon-cognito-user-pools-authentication-flow.html#amazon-cognito-user-pools-custom-authentication-flow)

## USER_AUTH flow

In order to facilitate the new passwordless sign in options, Cognito is introducing a new auth flow type known as `USER_AUTH`. This flow is designed to be flexible and supports both password and passwordless sign in factors.

### Set up auth backend

Configure supported flows in your Cognito app client. In the AWS Console, this is done by ticking the checkboxes at General settings > App clients > App client information (Edit) > App client flows. If you're using the AWS CLI or CloudFormation, update your app client by adding `USER_AUTH` to the list of "Explicit Auth Flows".

### User authentication flow

The `USER_AUTH` sign in flow will support the following methods of first factor authentication: `WEB_AUTHN`, `EMAIL_OTP`, `SMS_OTP`, `PASSWORD`, and `PASSWORD_SRP`.

```ts
type AuthFactorType = 
    | "WEB_AUTHN" 
    | "EMAIL_OTP" 
    | "SMS_OTP" 
    | "PASSWORD" 
    | "PASSWORD_SRP";
```

If the desired first factor is known before the sign in flow is initiated it can be passed to the initial sign in call.

Password flows will require the password to be passed in the same step. Passwordless flows do not require user input, and the challenges will be handled in the next sign in step:

```ts
// PASSWORD_SRP / PASSWORD
// sign in with preferred challenge as password
// note password must be provided in same step
const { nextStep } = await signIn({
    username: "hello@mycompany.com",
    password: "hunter2",
    options: {
        authFlowType: "USER_AUTH",
        preferredChallenge: "PASSWORD_SRP" // or "PASSWORD"
    },
});

// WEB_AUTHN / EMAIL_OTP / SMS_OTP
// sign in with preferred passwordless challenge
// no user input required at this step 
const { nextStep } = await signIn({
    username: "passwordless@mycompany.com",
    options: {
        authFlowType: "USER_AUTH",
        preferredChallenge: "WEB_AUTHN" // or "EMAIL_OTP" or "SMS_OTP"
    },
});
```

If the desired first factor is not known, the flow will continue to select an available first factor. 

> For more information about determining a first factor, and signing in with passwordless authorization factors, please visit the [concepts page for passwordless](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/concepts/passwordless/)

## USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow

A use case for the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow is migrating users into Amazon Cognito

### Set up auth backend

In order to use the authentication flow `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, your Cognito app client has to be configured to allow it. In the AWS Console, this is done by ticking the checkbox at General settings > App clients > Show Details (for the affected client) > Enable username-password (non-SRP) flow. If you're using the AWS CLI or CloudFormation, update your app client by adding `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` to the list of "Explicit Auth Flows".

### Migrate users with Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides a trigger to migrate users from your existing user directory seamlessly into Cognito. You achieve this by configuring your User Pool's "Migration" trigger which invokes a Lambda function whenever a user that does not already exist in the user pool authenticates, or resets their password.

In short, the Lambda function will validate the user credentials against your existing user directory and return a response object containing the user attributes and status on success. An error message will be returned if an error occurs. Visit [Amazon Cognito user pools import guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html) for migration flow and more detailed instruction, and [Amazon Cognito Lambda trigger guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-migrate-user.html#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-user-migration) on how to set up lambda to handle request and response objects.

## `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` & `CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP` flows

Amazon Cognito user pools supports customizing the authentication flow to enable custom challenge types, 
in addition to a password in order to verify the identity of users. These challenge types may include CAPTCHAs
or dynamic challenge questions. The `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` flow requires a password when calling `signIn`. Both of 
these flows map to the `CUSTOM_AUTH` flow in Cognito.

### Custom authentication flow

To initiate a custom authentication flow in your app, call `signIn` without a password. A custom challenge needs to be answered using the `confirmSignIn` API:

```ts title="src/main.ts"
import { signIn, confirmSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

const challengeResponse = 'the answer for the challenge';

const { nextStep } = await signIn({
  username,
  options: {
    authFlowType: 'CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP',
  },
});

if (nextStep.signInStep === 'CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_CUSTOM_CHALLENGE') {
  // to send the answer of the custom challenge
  await confirmSignIn({ challengeResponse });
}
```

### CAPTCHA authentication
