By default, Amplify Auth resources are scaffolded with email as the default method for your users to sign in. When you users sign up they receive a verification email to confirm their ownership of the email they specified during sign-up. Emails such as the verification email can be customized with your app's brand identity.

To get started, modify `email: true` to an object to begin customizing its default behavior:

```diff title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from "@aws-amplify/backend"

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
-   email: true, 
+   email: {
+     verificationEmailStyle: "CODE",
+     verificationEmailSubject: "Welcome to my app!",
+     verificationEmailBody: (createCode) => `Use this code to confirm your account: ${createCode()}`,
+   },
  },
})
```

{/* ## With react.email */}

{/* ## With jsx.email */}

{/* ## i18n */}
