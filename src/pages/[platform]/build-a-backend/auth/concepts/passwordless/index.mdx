Amplify supports the use of passwordless authentication flows using the following methods:

- [SMS-based one-time password (SMS OTP)](#sms-otp)
- [Email-based one-time password (Email OTP)](#email-otp)
- [WebAuthn passkey](#webauthn-passkey)

Passwordless authentication removes the security risks and user friction associated with traditional passwords.

<Callout warning>

**Warning:** Passwordless configuration is currently not available in `defineAuth`. We are currently working towards enabling support for passwordless configurations. [Visit the GitHub issue to track the progress](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-backend/issues/2276)

## SMS OTP

SMS-based authentication uses phone numbers as the identifier and text messages as the verification channel. At a high level end users will perform the following steps to authenticate:

1. User enters their phone number to sign up/sign in
2. They receive a text message with a time-limited code
3. After the user enters their code they are authenticated

SMS-based one-time password requires your Amazon Cognito user pool to be configured to use Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send text messages. [Learn how to configure your auth resource with SNS](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/moving-to-production/#sms).

## Email OTP

Email-based authentication uses email addresses for identification and verification. At a high level end users will perform the following steps to authenticate:

1. User enters their email address to sign up/sign in
2. They receive an email message with a time-limited code
3. After the users enters their code they are authenticated

## WebAuthn Passkey

WebAuthn uses biometrics or security keys for authentication, leveraging device-specific security features. At a high level end users will perform the following steps to authenticate:

1. User chooses to register a passkey
2. Their device prompts for biometric/security key verification
3. For future logins, they'll authenticate using the same method
