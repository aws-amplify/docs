Amplify Auth supports Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for user sign-in flows. MFA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that users trying to gain access to an account are who they say they are. It requires users to provide additional information to verify their identity. Amplify Auth supports the MFA methods with Time-based-One-Time Passwords (TOTP) as well as text messages (SMS). In this guide we will review how you can set up MFA using TOTP and SMS and the tradeoffs between these methods to help you choose the right set up for your application. We will also review how to set up MFA to remember a device and reduce sign-in friction for your users.

## Configure multi-factor authentication

Use `defineAuth` to enable MFA for your app. The example below is setting up MFA with TOTP but not SMS as you can see that the phone number is not a required attribute. If you are using SMS, then the `PhoneNumber` attribute must be `true`.

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  },
// highlight-start
  multifactor: {
    mode: 'OPTIONAL',
    totp: true
  }
// highlight-end
});
```

When multi-factor authentication (MFA) is REQUIRED with SMS in your backend auth resource, you will need to pass the phone number during sign-up API call. If you are using the `email` or `username` as the primary sign-in mechanism, you will need to pass the `phone_number` attribute as a user attribute. This will change depending on if you enable SMS, TOTP, or both. Visit the [multi-factor authentication documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/concepts/multi-factor-authentication/) to learn more about enabling MFA on your backend auth resource.

### Understand your MFA options

When enabling MFA you will have two key decisions to make:

- **MFA enforcement:** As part of this setup you will determine how MFA is enforced. If you require MFA by setting MFA login to "ON", all your users will need to complete MFA to sign in. If you keep it "Optional", your users will have the choice whether to enable MFA or not for their account.
- **MFA methods:** You will also specify which MFA method you are using - TOTP (Time-based One-time Password), SMS (text message), or both. We recommend that you use TOTP-based MFA as it is more secure and you can reserve SMS for account recovery.

<Accordion title='Compare TOTP and SMS MFA methods' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

|  | Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) | Short Message Service (SMS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Generates a short-lived numeric code for user authentication that includes a shared secret key and current time using an authenticator app. | Generates a one-time code shared via text message that is entered with other credentials for user authentication. |
| **Benefits** | More secure than SMS since the code is generated locally and not transmitted over a network. TOTP also works without cell service as long as the TOTP app is installed. | Easy to set up with a user-provided phone number and is familiar to users as a common authentication method. |
| **Constraints** | Requires an app to generate codes and adds to the initial setup of an account. Codes also expire quickly and must be used promptly after it is generated. | SMS requires cell service and can include an additional cost for the user. Although rare, SMS messages can also be intercepted. |

### Enable SMS MFA during sign-up

You will need to pass `phone_number` as a user attribute to enable SMS MFA for your users during sign-up. However, if the primary sign-in mechanism for your Cognito resource is `phone_number` (without enabling `username`), then you do not need to pass it as an attribute.

### Manage SMS MFA during sign-in

After a user signs in, if they have MFA enabled for their account, a challenge will be returned that you would need to call the `confirmSignIn` API where the user provides their confirmation code sent to their phone number.

If MFA is **ON** or enabled for the user, you must call `confirmSignIn` with the OTP sent to their phone.

You can use Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your web or mobile applications. The Amplify Auth category includes support for TOTP setup and verification using authenticator apps, offering an integrated solution and enhanced security for your users. These apps, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, have the TOTP algorithm built-in and work by using a shared secret key and the current time to generate short-lived, six digit passwords.

### Set up TOTP for a user

<InlineFilter filters={["angular", "javascript", "nextjs", "react", "vue", "android"]}>

After you initiate a user sign in with the `signIn` API where a user is required to set up TOTP as an MFA method, the API call will return `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` as a challenge and next step to handle in your app. You will get that challenge if the following conditions are met:

- MFA is marked as **Required** in your user pool.
- TOTP is enabled in your user pool.
- User does not have TOTP MFA set up already.

The `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` step signifies that the user must set up TOTP before they can sign in. The step returns an associated value of type `TOTPSetupDetails` which must be used to configure an authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. `TOTPSetupDetails` provides a helper method called `getSetupURI` which generates a URI that can be used, for example, in a button to open the user's installed authenticator app. For more advanced use cases, `TOTPSetupDetails` also contains a `sharedSecret` which can be used to either generate a QR code or be manually entered into an authenticator app.

Once the authenticator app is set up, the user can generate a TOTP code and provide it to the library to complete the sign in process.

```ts
import { signIn, SignInOutput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

const output = await signIn({
  username: "hello@mycompany.com",
  password: "hunter2"
});

const { nextStep } = output;
switch (nextStep.signInStep) {
  // ...
  case 'CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP':
    const totpSetupDetails = nextStep.totpSetupDetails;
    const appName = 'my_app_name';
    const setupUri = totpSetupDetails.getSetupUri(appName);
    // Open setupUri with an authenticator APP to retrieve an OTP code
    break;
  // ...
}
```

- MFA is marked as **Required** in your user pool.

### Enable TOTP after a user is signed in

TOTP MFA can be set up after a user has signed in. This can be done when the following conditions are met:

- MFA is marked as **Optional** or **Required** in your user pool.
- TOTP is marked as an enabled MFA method in your user pool.

TOTP can be set up by calling the `setUpTOTP` and `verifyTOTPSetup` APIs in the `Auth` category.

Invoke the `setUpTOTP` API to generate a `TOTPSetupDetails` object which should be used to configure an Authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. `TOTPSetupDetails` provides a helper method called `getSetupURI` which generates a URI that can be used, for example, in a button to open the user's installed Authenticator app. For more advanced use cases, `TOTPSetupDetails` also contains a `sharedSecret` which can be used to either generate a QR code or be manually entered into an Authenticator app.

Based on the Cognito user pool configuration, the administrator can use the [AdminSetUserMFAPreference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminSetUserMFAPreference.html) to either change the MFA preference to a different MFA method or to disable MFA for the user.

In a scenario where MFA is marked as "Required" in the Cognito User Pool and another MFA method is not set up, the administrator would need to first initiate an [`AdminUpdateUserAttributes`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminUpdateUserAttributes.html) call and update the user's phone number attribute. Once this is complete, the administrator can continue changing the MFA preference to SMS as suggested above.

## Set up a user's preferred MFA method

### Fetch the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to get the current MFA preference and enabled MFA types, if any, for the current user.

<InlineFilter filters={["angular", "javascript", "nextjs", "react", "vue", "android"]}>
```ts
import { fetchMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

const { enabled, preferred } = await fetchMFAPreference();
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["flutter"]}>
```dart
Future<void> getCurrentMfaPreference() async {
  final cognitoPlugin = Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito.pluginKey);

  final currentPreference = await cognitoPlugin.fetchMfaPreference();
  safePrint('Enabled MFA types for user: ${currentPreference.enabled}');
  safePrint('Preferred MFA type for user: ${currentPreference.preferred}');
}
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
```swift
func getMFAPreferences() async throws {
    let authCognitoPlugin = try Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(
        for: "awsCognitoAuthPlugin") as? AWSCognitoAuthPlugin

    let result = try await authCognitoPlugin?.fetchMFAPreference()

    print("Enabled MFA types: \(result?.enabled)")
    print("Preferred MFA type: \(result?.preferred)")
}
```
</InlineFilter>

### Update the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to update the MFA preference for the current user.

<Callout warning>

Only one MFA method can be marked as preferred at a time. If the user has multiple MFA methods enabled and tries to mark more than one MFA method as preferred, the API will throw an error.

If multiple MFA methods are enabled for the user, the `signIn` API will return `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_MFA_SELECTION` as the next step in the auth flow. During this scenario, the user should be prompted to select the MFA method they want to use to sign in and their preference should be passed to `confirmSignIn`.

```ts
import { confirmSignIn, SignInOutput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

## Remember a device

Remembering a device is useful in conjunction with MFA because it allows the second factor requirement to be automatically met when your user signs in on that device and reduces friction in their sign-in experience. By default, this feature is turned off.

<Callout info>

**Note:** The [device tracking and remembering](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/tracking-and-remembering-devices-using-amazon-cognito-your-user-pools/) features are not available if any of the following conditions are met:

- the federated OAuth flow with Cognito User Pools or Hosted UI is used, or
- when the `signIn` API uses the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` as the `authFlowType`.

</Callout>

### Configure device tracking

You can configure device tracking with `deviceTracking` construct.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
import { data } from './data/resource';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

const { cfnUserPool } = backend.auth.resources.cfnResources;

cfnUserPool.addPropertyOverride('DeviceConfiguration', {
  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice: true,
  DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt: false
});
```

<Accordion title='Understand key terms used for tracking devices' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

There are differences to keep in mind when working with remembered, forgotten, and tracked devices.

- **Tracked:** Every time the user signs in with a new device, the client is given the device key at the end of a successful authentication event. We use this device key to generate a salt and password verifier which is used to call the `ConfirmDevice` API. At this point, the device is considered to be "tracked". Once the device is in a tracked state, you can use the Amazon Cognito console to see the time it started to be tracked, last authentication time, and other information about that device.
- **Remembered:** Remembered devices are also tracked. During user authentication, the device key and secret pair assigned to a remembered device is used to authenticate the device to verify that it is the same device that the user previously used to sign in.
- **Not Remembered:** A not-remembered device is a tracked device where Cognito has been configured to require users to "Opt-in" to remember a device but the user has chosen not to remember the device. This use case is for users signing into their application from a device that they don't own.
- **Forgotten:** In the event that you no longer want to remember or track devices, you can use the `forgetDevice()` API to remove devices from being both remembered and tracked.
