Before you configure external sign-in with Amplify Auth you will need to set up your developer account with each provider you are using.

<Callout>

**Note:** Amazon Cognito provides first class support for Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple for seamless setup. However you can configure other Identity Providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC).

</Callout>

<Callout warning>

**Warning:** When configuring external sign-in it's important to exercise caution when designating attributes as "required." Different external identity providers have varied scopes in terms of the information they respond back to Cognito with.  User pool attributes that are initially set up as "required" cannot be changed later, and may require you to migrate the users or create a new user pool.

Your developer accounts with the external providers are now set up and you can return to the Amplify specific configuration.

## Configure external sign-in backend

In `amplify/auth/resource.ts` the external providers need to be added.

The following is an example of how you would set up access to all of the external providers supported by Amplify Auth. Please note you will need to configure your `callbackUrls` and `logoutUrls` URLs for your application, which will inform your backend resources how to behave when initiating sign in and sign out operations in your app.

<Callout>

Secrets must be created manually with [`ampx sandbox secret`](/[platform]/reference/cli-commands#npx-ampx-sandbox-secret) for use with cloud sandbox, or via the Amplify Console for branch environments.

</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth, secret } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalProviders: {
      google: {
        clientId: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      signInWithApple: {
        clientId: secret('SIWA_CLIENT_ID'),
        keyId: secret('SIWA_KEY_ID'),
        privateKey: secret('SIWA_PRIVATE_KEY'),
        teamId: secret('SIWA_TEAM_ID')
      },
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      facebook: {
        clientId: secret('FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com'],
    }
  }
});
```

You need to now inform your external provider of the newly configured authentication resource and its OAuth redirect URI:

### Customizing scopes for retrieving user data from external providers

You can determine the pieces of data you want to retrieve from each external provider when setting them up in the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file using `scopes`.

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalAuthProviders: {
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        // highlight-next-line
        scopes: ['email']
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com'],
    }
  }
});
```

### Attribute mapping

You can map which attributes are mapped between your external identity provider and your users created in Cognito. We will be able to have the best level of protection for developers if we ensure that attribute mappings that would not work are called out by the type system.

<Callout>

If you specify an attribute in your authentication resource as required, and it is not allowed for your external providers, signing in with that external provider will cause an error.

</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalAuthProviders: {
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        // highlight-start
        attributeMapping: {
          email: 'email'
        }
        // highlight-end
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com'],
    }
  }
});

## Configure OIDC provider

To setup a OIDC provider, you can configure them in your `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file. For example, if you would like to setup a Microsoft EntraID provider, you can do so as follows:

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth, secret } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      oidc: [
        {
          name: 'MicrosoftEntraID',
          clientId: secret('MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID'),
          clientSecret: secret('MICROSOFT_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_SECRET'),
          issuerUrl: '<your-issuer-url>',
        },
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com'],
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile',
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

<InlineFilter filters={["angular", "javascript", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>

Use the `signInWithRedirect` API to initiate sign-in with an OIDC identity provider.

```ts title="src/my-client-side-js.js"
import { signInWithRedirect } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

await signInWithRedirect({
  provider: {
    custom: 'MicrosoftEntraID'
  }
});
```
</InlineFilter>

## Configure SAML provider

To setup a SAML provider, you can configure them in your `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file. For example, if you would like to setup a Microsoft EntraID provider, you can do so as follows:

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      saml: {
        name: 'MicrosoftEntraIDSAML',
        metadata: {
          metadataContent: '<your-url-hosting-saml-metadata>', // or content of the metadata file
          metadataType: 'URL', // or 'FILE'
        },
      },
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com'],
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile',
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

### (Required for Multi-Page Applications) Complete external Sign In after Redirect

If you are developing a multi-page application, and the redirected page is not the same page that initiated the sign in, you will need to add the following code to the redirected page to ensure the sign in gets completed:

```ts title="src/my-redirected-page.ts"
import 'aws-amplify/auth/enable-oauth-listener';
import { getCurrentUser, fetchUserAttributes } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify/utils';

Hub.listen("auth", ({ payload }) => {
  switch (payload.event) {
    case "signInWithRedirect":
      const user = await getCurrentUser();
      const userAttributes = await fetchUserAttributes();
      console.log({user, userAttributes});
      break;
    case "signInWithRedirect_failure":
      // handle sign in failure
      break;
    case "customOAuthState":
      const state = payload.data; // this will be customState provided on signInWithRedirect function
      console.log(state);
      break;
  }
});
```

<Callout>

**Note:** The listener only works on the client side in the context of a SSR-enabled project, so ensure to import the listener on the client side only. For example, in a Next.js project, you should add the above import statement to a component that renders on the client side only by `'use client'`.

</Callout>

<Accordion eyebrow="Under the hood" headingLevel="4" title="Why external Sign In needs to be explicitly handled for Multi-Page Applications">

When you import and use the `signInWithRedirect` function, it will add a listener as a side effect that will complete the external sign in when an end user is redirected back to your app. This works well in a single-page application but in a multi-page application, you might get redirected to a page that doesn't include the listener that was originally added as a side-effect. Hence you must include the specific OAuth listener on your login success page.
