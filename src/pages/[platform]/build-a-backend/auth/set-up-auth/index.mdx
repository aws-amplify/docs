In this guide, you will learn how to set up authentication in your Amplify Gen 2 app. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources and enabling sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out with the Authenticator UI component. We will also provide more context on how resources are managed and created with Amplify to help you make decisions and understand any long-term impact of those decisions.

If you have not yet created an Amplify Gen 2 app, visit the [quickstart](/[platform]/start/quickstart).

## Building your auth backend

### Configure auth resource

To configure your auth backend, edit the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file. You can set up sign-in mechanisms that work with either an email/phone and password combination, or through integration with social provider sign-in options.

<Accordion title='Understanding Auth high-level concepts' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

- _Authentication_ is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as _AuthN_). The system that does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
- _Authorization_ is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as _AuthZ_). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include:

- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties.

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by:

- Modifying the default password policy to ensure your users create stronger passwords.
- Requiring additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.

</Accordion>

At a minimum, you will need to pass a `loginWith` value to set up how your users sign in to your app. Signing in with email and password is configured by default if you do not provide any value.

```

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery, and other operations. If you have not worked with Amazon Cognito before, we recommend taking a closer look at Amazon Cognito configuration options before you continue, since some of them are irreversible after your resources are created.

<Accordion title='Review Amazon Cognito configuration options' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amazon Cognito can be customized based on your security strategy for authentication. However, some initial configuration options cannot be changed after the backend resources are configured:

- User attributes that are used to identify your individual users (such as username and email) cannot be renamed or deleted.
- Sign-in methods (including username, email, and phone) cannot be added or changed after the initial configuration. This includes both defining which attributes are used to sign in and which attributes are required. Required attributes must have a value for all users once set.
- Verification methods (including username and email) are the same as required attributes and cannot be removed once configured.
- The `sub` attribute is a unique identifier within each user pool that cannot be modified and can be used to index and search users.
- If MFA is set to **required** for all users, you will need to include MFA setup when users sign up.

See the [Amazon Cognito documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) for more details on these settings, including [User pool attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) and [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).

</Accordion>

### Deploy auth resource

After you have chosen and set up your authentication resource, run the following command to create your first authentication resource in your personal cloud sandbox.

<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal"
npx amplify sandbox --config-format dart --config-out-dir lib
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['angular','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','vue']}>
```bash title="Terminal"

```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>
```bash title="Terminal"
npx amplify sandbox --config-format=json-mobile
```
</InlineFilter>

After a successful deployment, this command also generates a configuration file (`amplifyconfiguration.json`) to enable your frontend app to connect to your backend resources. The values you configure in your backend authentication resource are set in the generated configuration file to automatically configure the frontend [`Authenticator connected component`](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator).

## Connect your application code to the auth backend

Creating and correctly implementing the sign-in flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Amplify's Authenticator UI component streamlines this by enabling you to rapidly build the entire authentication flow for your app. The component works seamlessly with configuration in `amplify/auth/resource.ts` to automatically connect with your backend resources.

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to the Amplify console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

In your app's entry point (specifically, **App.js**, **index.js**, **\_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './amplifyconfiguration.json';
Amplify.configure(config);
```

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.

<Block name="Amplify Studio">

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/[platform]/start/project-setup/prerequisites/) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify Libraries.

Amplify Studio allows you to create auth resources, set up authorization rules, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more through an intuitive UI. To set up Authentication through Amplify Studio, take the following steps:

1. **Sign in** to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and open AWS Amplify.
2. In the navigation pane, **choose an application**.
3. On the application information page, choose the **Backend environments** tab, then choose **Launch Studio**.
4. On the **Set up** menu, choose **Authentication**.
5. In the **Configure login** section, choose a login mechanism to add from the **Add login mechanism** list. Valid options are _Username_, _Phone number_, _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, and _Sign in with Apple_. If you choose one of the social sign-in mechanisms (specifically, _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, or _Sign in with Apple_), you will also need to enter your _App ID_, _App Secret_, and redirect URLs.
6. (Optional) Add multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is set to **Off** by default. To turn on MFA, do the following in the **Multi-factor authentication** section:

- Choose **Enforced** to require MFA for all users or choose **Optional** to allow individual users to enable MFA.
- (Optional) Choose **SMS**, and enter your SMS message.
- (Optional) Choose **Authenticator Application** if you want your app to load with an authentication flow that includes sign-up and sign-in.

7. In the **Configure sign-up** section, expand **Password protection settings** and customize the password policy settings to enforce. Choose **Save and Deploy**. This starts a CloudFormation deployment with the progress displayed in the upper right corner of the page.
8. After creating and configuring your auth resources, you will need to pull them down from Amplify Studio. To do so, simply select "Local setup instructions" in the upper right-hand corner of the Studio console and run the CLI command it provides at the root directory of your app.

You now have set up and configured your backend resources for Amplify Auth, and connected your frontend app to your backend. You are now ready to work on your frontend application.

## Determine your Auth integration path

Before you implement Auth on your frontend application, you will want to evaluate the options of using the Authenticator connected UI component or using the Amplify Library APIs directly. We recommend using the Authenticator since it creates a customizable sign-in and registration experience for your app with a few lines of code.

### Compare implementation options

There are a few options to implement Auth, depending on how much customization you will need:

|  | Amplify Authenticator | Amplify Libraries |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Description** | Open source drop-in UI component for authentication | Low-level building blocks for implementing authentication |
| **Benefits** | Automatically integrates with your existing Amplify configuration and allows you to easily add the entire authentication flow to your application. You can then customize themes to adjust colors and styling as needed. | Gives you full control over the UI and logic implementation. |
| **Constraints** | Dependent on Amplify CLI for provisioning resources. | Requires the building of screens and frontend logic to enable the sign-in and registration experiences. |

<br />

We recommend using the Authenticator UI component for quick and easy setup and then use the Amplify Libraries to customize the user experience and logic as needed. Once you decide which option will work for your use case, you can continue implementing authentication on your frontend application. If you prefer to work directly with the APIs, you can review the [_Enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out_](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/enable-sign-up/) guide.

## Build an Authentication experience using the Authenticator

Creating the sign-in flow can be quite difficult and time-consuming to get right. However, Amplify has the Authenticator UI component which you can use to quickly build the entire authentication flow for your app, using your backend configuration.

Amplify has pre-built UI components for React, Vue, Angular, React Native, Swift, Android, and Flutter. In this guide, we are focusing on those for web applications.

Next, update the `init` part of your `MyAmplifyAppApp.swift` file with the following code:

```swift title="MyAmplifyApp.swift"
import Amplify
import Authenticator
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import SwiftUI

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    init() {
        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            try Amplify.configure()
        } catch {
            print("Unable to configure Amplify \(error)")
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            Authenticator { state in
                VStack {
                    Text("Hello, \(state.user.username)")
                    Button("Sign out") {
                        Task {
                            await state.signOut()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The Authenticator component is built using (Jetpack Compose)[https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose]. Enable Jetpack Compose by adding the following to the android section of your app's build.gradle file:

```groovy showLineNumbers={false}
compileOptions {
    // Support for Java 8 features
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
buildFeatures {
    compose true
}
composeOptions {
  kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion '1.2.0'
}
```

Add the following dependencies to your *app*'s `build.gradle` file and click "Sync Now" when prompted:

class MyAmplifyApp: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        try {
            // highlight-next-line
            Amplify.addPlugin(AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            Amplify.configure(applicationContext)
            Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Initialized Amplify")
        } catch (error: AmplifyException) {
            Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Could not initialize Amplify", error)
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly update your MainActivity.kt file to use the Amplify UI components:

```kotlin

import androidx.activity.ComponentActivity
import androidx.activity.compose.setContent
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.fillMaxSize

import androidx.compose.ui.tooling.preview.Preview
import com.amplifyframework.core.Amplify
import com.amplifyframework.ui.authenticator.ui.Authenticator
// highlight-next-line
import <your-package-name>.ui.theme.MyAmplifyAppTheme

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            MyAmplifyAppTheme {
                // A surface container using the 'background' color from the theme
                Surface(
                    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
                    color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
                ) {
                    // highlight-next-line
                    Authenticator { state ->
                        Column {
                            Text(
                                text = "Hello ${state.user.username}!",
                            )
                            Button(onClick = {
                                // highlight-next-line
                                Amplify.Auth.signOut {  }
                            }) {
                                Text(text = "Sign Out")
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Once you add the Authenticator component to your app, you can test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality. You can also [customize the Authenticator connected component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator/customization) to adjust colors and styling as needed.

## Manage users in the Amplify console

Once you deploy your code to Git, you can manage users and groups for the branch environment in the Amplify console.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Set up Amplify Auth** guide. In this guide, you set up and connected to backend resources, compared and determined your Auth integration path, and enabled sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.

### Next steps

Now that you have completed setting up authentication in your Amplify app with email and password, you may also want to add some additional features. We recommend you learn more about:

- [Adding social provider sign-in](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/add-social-provider/)
- [Managing MFA settings](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa/)
