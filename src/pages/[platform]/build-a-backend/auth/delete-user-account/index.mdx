Empowering users to delete their account can improve trust and transparency. You can programmatically enable self-service account deletion with Amplify Auth.

If you have not yet created an Amplify Gen 2 app, visit the [quickstart](/[platform]/start/quickstart).

## Allow users to delete their account

You can quickly set up account deletion for your users with the Amplify Libraries. Invoking the `deleteUser` API to delete a user from the Auth category will also sign out your user.

If your application uses a Cognito User Pool, which is the default configuration, this action will only delete the user from the Cognito User Pool. It will have no effect if you are federating with a Cognito Identity Pool alone.

<Callout warning>

Before invoking the `deleteUser` API, you may need to first delete associated user data that is not stored in Cognito. For example, if you are using Amplify Data to persist user data, you could follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/aws-amplify-ops/27954c421bd72930874d48c15c284807) to delete associated user data. This allows you to address any guidelines (such as GDPR) that require your app to delete data associated with a user who deletes their account.

You can enable account deletion using the following method:

We recommend you update your UI to let your users know that their account is deleted and test the functionality with a test user. Note that your user will be signed out of your application when they delete their account.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Delete user account** guide and learned how to enable account deletion for your users.

### Next steps

Now that you enabled account deletion you may also want to add some additional features. We recommend you learn more about:

- [Manage user profile](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/manage-user-profile/)
- [Set up password change and recovery](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/password-management/)
