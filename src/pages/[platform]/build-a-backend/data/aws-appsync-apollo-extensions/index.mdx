## Connecting to AWS AppSync with Apollo client

<InlineFilter filters={["android"]}>

### Creating the ApolloClient

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="With Amplify">
Before you begin, you will need an Amplify Data backend deploy. To get started, see [Set up Data](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/set-up-data/). 

Once you have deployed your backend and created the `amplify_outputs.json` file, you can use Amplify library to read and retrieve your configuration values with the following steps:

```kotlin
// Use apiKey auth mode, reading configuration from AmplifyOutputs
val connector = ApolloAmplifyConnector(context, AmplifyOutputs(R.raw.amplify_outputs))
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .appSync(connector.endpoint, connector.apiKeyAuthorizer())
    .build()
```
</Block>

<Block name="Without Amplify">
You can create your Apollo client by using our provided AWS AppSync endpoint and authorizer classes. 

```kotlin
val endpoint = AppSyncEndpoint("<your_appsync_endpoint>")
// Continue Reading to see more authorizer examples
val authorizer = ApiKeyAuthorizer("[API_KEY]") 
val apolloClient = ApolloClient.Builder()
    .appSync(endpoint, authorizer)
    .build()
```
</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

### Providing AppSync Authorizers

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="With Amplify">

The AWS AppSync Apollo Extensions library provides a number of Authorizer classes to match the various authorization strategies that may be in use in your schema. You should choose the appropriate Authorizer type for your authorization strategy. To read more about the strategies and their corresponding auth modes, see [Available authorization strategies](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/#available-authorization-strategies).

Some common ones are

*  `publicAPIkey` strategy, `apiKey` authMode, **APIKeyAuthorizer**
*  `guest` strategy, `identityPool` authMode, **IAMAuthorizer**
*  `owner` strategy, `userPool` authMode, **AuthTokenAuthorizer**

If you define multiple authorization strategies within your schema, you will have to create separate Apollo client instances for each Authorizer that you want to use in your app.

#### API_KEY

An `ApiKeyAuthorizer` can read the API key from `amplify_outputs.json`, provide a hardcoded API key, or fetch the API key from some source:

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Using ApolloAmplifyConnector to read API key from amplify_outputs.json
val connector = ApolloAmplifyConnector(context, AmplifyOutputs(R.raw.amplify_outputs))
val authorizer = connector.apiKeyAuthorizer()
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Use a hard-coded API key
val authorizer = ApiKeyAuthorizer("[API_KEY]")
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Fetch the API key from some source. This function may be called many times,
// so it should implement appropriate caching internally.
val authorizer = ApiKeyAuthorizer { fetchApiKey() }
//highlight-end
```

#### AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS

You can use `AmplifyApolloConnector` to get an `AuthTokenAuthorizer` instance that supplies the token for the current logged-in Amplify user, or implement the token fetching yourself.

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Using ApolloAmplifyConnector to get the authorizer that connects to your 
// Amplify instance
val connector = ApolloAmplifyConnector(context, AmplifyOutputs(R.raw.amplify_outputs))
val authorizer = connector.authTokenAuthorizer()
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Using the ApolloAmplifyConnector companion function
val authorizer = AuthTokenAuthorizer { 
  ApolloAmplifyConnector.fetchLatestCognitoAuthToken() 
}
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Use your own token fetching. This function may be called many times,
// so it should implement appropriate caching internally.
val authorizer = AuthTokenAuthorizer {
  fetchLatestAuthToken()
}
//highlight-end
```

You can provide your own custom `fetchLatestAuthToken` provider for **AWS_LAMBDA** and **OPENID_CONNECT** auth modes. 

#### AWS_IAM

You can use the `ApolloAmplifyConnector` to delegate token fetching and request 
signing to Amplify.

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Using ApolloAmplifyConnector to get the authorizer that connects to your 
// Amplify instance
val connector = ApolloAmplifyConnector(context, AmplifyOutputs(R.raw.amplify_outputs))
val authorizer = connector.iamAuthorizer()
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Using the ApolloAmplifyConnector companion function
val authorizer = IamAuthorizer { 
  ApolloAmplifyConnector.signAppSyncRequest(it, "us-east-1") 
}
//highlight-end
```

</Block>

<Block name="Without Amplify">

AWS AppSync supports the following [authorization modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html). Use the corresponding Authorizer that matches the chosen authorization type. 

Some common ones are

*  API Key Authorization -> **APIKeyAuthorizer**
*  IAM Authorization -> **IAMAuthorizer**
*  Cognito User Pools -> **AuthTokenAuthorizer**

If you apply multiple authorization directives in your schema, you will have to create separate Apollo client instances for each Authorizer that you want to use in your app.

#### API_KEY

An `ApiKeyAuthorizer` can be used with a hardcoded API key or by fetching the key from some source.:

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Use a hard-coded API key
val authorizer = ApiKeyAuthorizer("[API_KEY]")
//highlight-end
// or
// highlight-start
// Fetch the API key from some source. This function may be called many times,
// so it should implement appropriate caching internally.
val authorizer = ApiKeyAuthorizer { fetchApiKey() }
//highlight-end
```

#### AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS

When working directly with AppSync, you must implement the token fetching yourself.

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Use your own token fetching. This function may be called many times,
// so it should implement appropriate caching internally.
val authorizer = AuthTokenAuthorizer {
  fetchLatestAuthToken()
}
//highlight-end
```

#### AWS_IAM

When working directly with AppSync, you must implement the request signing yourself.

```kotlin
// highlight-start
// Provide an implementation of the signing function. This function should implement the 
// AWS Sig-v4 signing logic and return the authorization headers containing the token and signature.
val authorizer = IamAuthorizer { signRequestAndReturnHeaders(it) }
// highlight-end
```

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
AWS AppSync supports the following [authorization modes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html):

### API_KEY

```swift
import AWSAppSyncApolloExtensions

let authorizer = APIKeyAuthorizer(apiKey: "[API_KEY]")
let interceptor = AppSyncInterceptor(authorizer)
```

### AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS

If you are using Amplify Auth, you can create a method that retrieves the Cognito access token

```swift
import Amplify

func getUserPoolAccessToken() async throws -> String {
    let authSession = try await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession()
    if let result = (authSession as? AuthCognitoTokensProvider)?.getCognitoTokens() {
        switch result {
        case .success(let tokens):
            return tokens.accessToken
        case .failure(let error):
            throw error
        }
    }
    throw AuthError.unknown("Did not receive a valid response from fetchAuthSession for get token.")
}
```

Then create the AuthTokenAuthorizer with this method.

```swift
import AWSAppSyncApolloExtensions

let authorizer = AuthTokenAuthorizer(fetchLatestAuthToken: getUserPoolAccessToken)
let interceptor = AppSyncInterceptor(authorizer)
```

### AWS_IAM

If you are using Amplify Auth, you can use the following method for AWS_IAM auth

```swift
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSAppSyncApolloExtensions

let authorizer = IAMAuthorizer(
    signRequest: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin.createAppSyncSigner(
        region: "[REGION]"))
```

## Connecting Amplify Data to Apollo client

Before you begin, you will need an Amplify Data backend deploy. To get started, see [Set up Data](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/set-up-data/). 

Once you have deployed your backend and created the `amplify_outputs.json` file, you can use Amplify library to read and retrieve your configuration values with the following steps:

1. Enter its GitHub URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`), select **Up to Next Major Version** and click **Add Package**
2. Select the following libraries:
    1. **AWSPluginsCore**
3. Drag and drop the `amplify_outputs.json` file into your Xcode project. 
4. Initialize the configuration with `try AWSAppSyncConfiguration(with: .amplifyOutputs)`

The resulting configuration object will have the `endpoint`, `region`, and optional `apiKey.` The following example shows reading the `amplify_outputs.json` file from the main bundle to instantiate the configuration and uses it to configure the Apollo client for **API_Key** authorization.

```swift
import Apollo
import ApolloAPI
import AWSPluginsCore
import AWSAppSyncApolloExtensions

func createApolloClient() throws -> ApolloClient {
   let store = ApolloStore(cache: InMemoryNormalizedCache())
   
    // 1. Read AWS AppSync API configuration from `amplify_outputs.json`
    let configuration = try AWSAppSyncConfiguration(with: .amplifyOutputs)
    
   // 2. Use `configuration.apiKey` with APIKeyAuthorizer
    let authorizer = APIKeyAuthorizer(apiKey: configuration.apiKey ?? "")
    let interceptor = AppSyncInterceptor(authorizer)
    let interceptorProvider = DefaultPrependInterceptorProvider(interceptor: interceptor,
                                                                store: store)
   // 3. Use `configuration.endpoint` with RequestChainNetworkTransport
    let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(interceptorProvider: interceptorProvider,
                                                endpointURL: configuration.endpoint)

    return ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)
}
```

<Block name="With Amplify">
**Amplify provided .graphql files**
1. Within your Amplify Gen 2 backend, run: `npx ampx generate graphql-client-code --format graphql-codegen --statement-target graphql --out graphql`
2. Copy the generated files (`mutations.graphql`, `queries.graphql`, `subscriptions.graphql`) to your `{app}/src/main/graphql` folder as shown in the [Apollo documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin#getting-started)

**Manual**
1. Navigate to the **Queries** tab in your API on the [AWS AppSync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/home). Here, you can test queries, mutations, and subscriptions in the GraphQL playground.
2. Enter your GraphQL operation (query, mutation, or subscription) in the editor and select **Run** to execute it.
3. Observe the request and response structure in the results. This gives you insight into the exact call patterns and structure that Apollo will use.
4. Copy the GraphQL operation(s) from the playground and pass them to to your `{app}/src/main/graphql` folder as shown in the [Apollo documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin#getting-started)

## Type Mapping AppSync Scalars
By default, [AWS AppSync Scalars](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/scalars.html#graph-ql-aws-appsync-scalars) will default to the `Any` type. You can map these scalars to more explicit types by editing the `apollo` block in your `app/build.gradle[.kts]` file. In the example below, we are now mapping a few of our AppSync scalar types to `String` instead of `Any`. Additional improvements could be made by writing [custom class adapters](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/essentials/custom-scalars#define-class-mapping) to convert date/time scalars into Kotlin date/time class types.

```kotlin
apollo {
    service("{serviceName}") {
        packageName.set("{packageName}")
        mapScalarToKotlinString("AWSDateTime")
        mapScalarToKotlinString("AWSEmail")
