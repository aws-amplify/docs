The `ownersDefinedIn` rule grants a set of users access to a record by automatically creating an `owners` field to store the allowed record owners. You can override the default owners field name by specifying `inField` with the desired field name to store the owner information. You can dynamically manage which users can access a record by updating the owner field.

## Add multi-user authorization rule

If you want to grant a set of users access to a record, you use the `ownersDefinedIn` rule. This automatically creates a `owners: a.string().array()` field to store the allowed owners.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.ownersDefinedIn('owners')]),
});
```

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using `client.models.<model-name>` with the `userPool` auth mode.

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource'; // Path to your backend resource definition

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

// Create a record with current user as first owner
const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create(
  {
    content: 'My new todo',
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    authMode: 'userPool',
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```
```ts
// Add another user as an owner
await client.models.Todo.update(
  {
    id: newTodo.id,
    owners: [...(newTodo.owners as string[]), otherUserId],
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    authMode: "userPool"
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

## Override to a list of owners

You can override the `inField` to a list of owners. Use this if you want a dynamic set of users to have access to a record. In the example below, the `authors` list is populated with the creator of the record upon record creation. The creator can then update the `authors` field with additional users. Any user listed in the `authors` field can access the record.

```ts
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
      authors: a.string().array(), // record owner information now stored in "authors" field
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.ownersDefinedIn('authors')]),
});
```
