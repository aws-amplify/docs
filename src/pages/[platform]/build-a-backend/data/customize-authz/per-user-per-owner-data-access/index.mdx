The `owner` authorization strategy restricts operations on a record to only the record's owner. When configured, the `owner` field will automatically be added and populated with the identity of the created user. The API will authorize against the `owner` field to allow or deny operations.

## Add per-user/per-owner authorization rule

You can use the `owner` authorization strategy to restrict a record's access to a specific user. When `owner` authorization is configured, only the record's `owner` is allowed the specified operations.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// The "owner" of a Todo is allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own todos
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.owner()]),
});
```

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// The "owner" of a Todo record is only allowed to create, read, and update it.
// The "owner" of a Todo record is denied to delete it.
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.owner().to(['create', 'read', 'update'])]),
});
```

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using `client.models.<model-name>` with the `userPool` auth mode.

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource'; // Path to your backend resource definition

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create(
  {
    content: 'My new todo',
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    authMode: 'userPool',
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model with the `userPools` auth mode.
  
```dart
try {
  final todo = Todo(content: 'My new todo');
  final request = ModelMutations.create(
    todo,  
    authorizationMode: APIAuthorizationType.userPools,
  );
  final createdTodo = await Amplify.API.mutations(request: request).response;

  if (createdTodo == null) {
    safePrint('errors: ${response.errors}');
    return;
  }
  safePrint('Mutation result: ${createdTodo.name}');

} on APIException catch (e) {
  safePrint('Failed to create todo', e);
}
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model with the `amazonCognitoUserPools` auth mode.

```swift
do {
    let todo = Todo(content: "My new todo")
    let createdTodo = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(
        todo,
        authMode: .amazonCognitoUserPools)).get()
} catch {
    print("Failed to create todo", error)
}
```
</InlineFilter>

Behind the scenes, Amplify will automatically add a `owner: a.string()` field to each record which contains the record owner's identity information upon record creation.

By default, the Cognito user pool's user information is populated into the `owner` field. The value saved includes `sub` and `username` in the format `<sub>::<username>`. The API will authorize against the full value of `<sub>::<username>` or `sub` / `username` separately and return `username`. You can alternatively configure [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider).

<Callout warning>

**By default, owners can reassign the owner of their existing record to another user.**

To prevent an owner from reassigning their record to another user, protect the owner field (by default `owner: String`) with a [field-level authorization rule](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/#field-level-authorization-rules). For example, in a social media app, you would want to prevent Alice from being able to reassign Alice's Post to Bob.

```ts
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
      owner: a.string().authorization(allow => [allow.owner().to(['read', 'delete'])]),
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.owner()]),
});
```

</Callout>

## Customize the owner field

You can override the `owner` field to your own preferred field, by specifying a custom `ownerField` in the authorization rule.

```ts
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
      author: a.string(), // record owner information now stored in "author" field
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.ownerDefinedIn('author')]),
});
```
