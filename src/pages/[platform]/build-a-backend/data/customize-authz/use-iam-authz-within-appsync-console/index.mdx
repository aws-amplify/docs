IAM-based `.authorization()` rules are scoped down to only work with Amplify-generated IAM roles from `amplify/auth/resource.ts`. To access the Amplify Data-generated API with IAM authorization within your AppSync console, you need to explicitly allow list the IAM user's name.

To grant an external AWS Resource or an IAM role access to Amplify Data's API, you will need to explicitly list the IAM roles by adding them to the `allowListedRoleNames` property.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    description: a.string(),
  }),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // Pass in the IAM user's role name to grant full read/write access to the API
    // if their IAM policies permit it.
    allowListedRoleNames: ["userRole"],
  },
});
```

These "Allow-listed Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `.authorization()` rule.
