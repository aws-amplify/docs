The `disableOperations` method allows you to selectively disable specific GraphQL operations for a model in your Amplify application. This can be useful for enforcing access control patterns, optimizing performance, or implementing specialized API designs.

## Usage
You can disable operations by adding the `disableOperations` method to your model definition:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
export const schema = a.schema({
  Customer: a
    .model({
      name: a.string(),
      phoneNumber: a.phone(),
      accountRepresentativeId: a.id().required(),
    })
      // highlight-next-line
    .disableOperations(["mutations","subcriptions","queries"])
    .authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]),
});
```

## Available Operation Types

The `disableOperations` method accepts an array of operation types that you want to disable:

### General Operation Categories

"mutations": Disables all mutation operations (create, update, delete)
"subscriptions": Disables all real-time subscription operations (onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete)
"queries": Disables all query operations (get, list)

### Specific Operations
You can also disable more granular operations:
Query Operations

"get": Disables the ability to fetch a single item by ID
"list": Disables the ability to fetch multiple items

### Mutation Operations

"create": Disables the ability to create new items
"update": Disables the ability to update existing items
"delete": Disables the ability to delete items

### Subscription Operations

"onCreate": Disables real-time notifications when items are created
"onUpdate": Disables real-time notifications when items are updated
"onDelete": Disables real-time notifications when items are deleted

You can specify one or more operation types in the array to disable them:

```
// Disable all mutations
disableOperations: ["mutations"]

// Disable both subscriptions and queries
disableOperations: ["subscriptions", "queries"]

// Disable specific operations
disableOperations: ["create", "update", "list"]

// Disable specific subscription types
disableOperations: ["onCreate", "onUpdate"]

// Mix general categories with specific operations
disableOperations: ["queries", "create", "onDelete"]
```
