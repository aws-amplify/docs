The Storage and GraphQL API categories can be used together to associate a file, such as an image or video, with a particular record. For example, you might create a `User` model with a profile picture, or a `Post` model with an associated image. With Amplify's GraphQL API and Storage categories, you can reference the file within the model itself to create an association.

## Set up the project

Set up your project by following the instructions in the [Quickstart guide](/[platform]/start/quickstart/).

## Define the model

Open `amplify/data/resource.ts` and add the following model as shown below:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

const schema = a.schema({
  Song: a
    .model({
      id: a.id().required(),
      name: a.string().required(),
      coverArtPath: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization((allow) => [allow.publicApiKey()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: "apiKey",

    apiKeyAuthorizationMode: {
      expiresInDays: 30,
    },
  },
});
```
## Setup the Storage

Next, Let's configure Storage and allow access to all authenticated(signed in) users of your application. create a file `amplify/storage/resource.ts` and add the following code,This will restrict file access to only the signed-in user.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"

import { defineStorage } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: "amplify-gen2-files",
  access: (allow) => ({
    "images/*": [allow.authenticated.to(["read", "write", "delete"])],
  }),
});
```

Configure the storage in the `amplify/backend.ts` file as demonstrated below:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
import { auth } from "./auth/resource";
import { data } from "./data/resource";
import { storage } from "./storage/resource";

export const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data,
  storage,
});
```

## Configuring authorization

Your application needs authorization credentials for reading and writing to both Storage and the Data, except in the case where all data and files are intended to be publicly accessible.

The Storage and Data categories govern data access based on their own authorization patterns, meaning that it's necessary to configure appropriate auth roles for each individual category. Although both categories share the same access credentials set up through the Auth category, they work independently from one another. For instance, adding an `allow.authenticated()` to the Data does not guard against file access in the Storage category. Likewise, adding authorization rules to the Storage category does not guard against data access in the API.

When you configure Storage, Amplify will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using a Cognito Identity Pool role. You will then have the option of adding CRUD (Create, Update, Read and Delete) based permissions as well, so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted limited permissions within these levels. **Even after adding this configuration, all Storage access is still `guest` by default.** To guard against accidental public access, the Storage access levels must either be configured on the Storage object globally, or set within individual function calls. This guide uses the former approach, setting all Storage access to `authenticated` users.

The ability to independently configure authorization rules for each category allows for more granular control over data access, and adds greater flexibility. For scenarios where authorization patterns must be mixed and matched, configure the access level on individual Storage function calls. For example, you may want to use `entity_id` CRUD access on an individual Storage function call for files that should only be accessible by the owner (such as personal files), `authenticated` read access to allow all logged in users to view common files (such as images in a shared photo album), and `guest` read access to allow all users to view a file (such as a public profile picture).

For more details on how to configure Storage authorization levels, see the [Storage documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/). For more on configuring Data authorization, see the [API documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/).

## Create a record with an associated file

You can create a record via the Amplify Data client, upload a file to Storage, and finally update the record to associate it with the uploaded file. Use the following example with the Amplify Data client and Amplify Storage library helpers, `uploadData` and `getUrl`, to create a record and associate it the file with the record.

<Callout>

The API record's `id` is prepended to the Storage file name to ensure uniqueness. If this is excluded, multiple API records could then be associated with the same file path unintentionally.

</Callout>

```

const client = generateClient<Schema>({

## Add or update a file for an associated record

To associate a file with a record, update the record with the path returned by the Storage upload. The following example uploads the file using Storage, updates the record with the file's path, then retrieves the signed URL to download the image. If an image is already associated with the record, this will update the record with the new image.

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>

    print("Could not get data from UIImage.")
    return
}

let coverArtPath = "images/\(currentSong.id)"

// Upload the new art image
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(path: .fromString(coverArtPath), data: imageData).value

// Update the song record
currentSong.coverArtPath = coverArtPath

```

const signedURL = await getUrl({ path: updatedSong.coverArtPath });
```

</InlineFilter>

## Query a record and retrieve the associated file

To retrieve the file associated with a record, first query the record, then use Storage to get the signed URL. The signed URL can then be used to download the file, display an image, etc:
<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
```swift title="ContentView"
// Get the song record
guard let song = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id)).get() else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song by id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}

// If the record has no associated file, we can return early.
guard let coverArtPath = song.coverArtPath else {
    print("Song does not contain cover art")
    return
}

// Download the art cover
print("coverArtPath: ", coverArtPath)
let imageData = try await Amplify.Storage.downloadData(path: .fromString(coverArtPath)).value

let image = UIImage(data: imageData)
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={[

const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  authMode: "apiKey",
});

const response = await client.models.Song.get({
  id: currentSong.id,
});

const song = response.data;

// If the record has no associated file, we can return early.
if (!song?.coverArtPath) return;

// Retrieve the signed URL:
const signedURL = await getUrl({ path: song.coverArtPath });
```
</InlineFilter>

## Delete and remove files associated with API records

There are three common deletion workflows when working with Storage files and the GraphQL API:

1. Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record.
2. Remove the record association and delete the file.
3. Delete both file and record.

### Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record

The following example removes the file association from the record, but does not delete the file from S3, nor the record from the database.

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
```swift title="ContentView"
// Get the song record
guard var song = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id)).get() else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song by id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}

guard song.coverArtPath != nil else {
    print("There is no cover art path to remove image association")
    return
}

// Set the association to nil and update it
song.coverArtPath = nil

let updatedSong = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(song)).get()
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={[
  "javascript", "react-native", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"

});

const response = await client.models.Song.get({
  id: currentSong.id,
});

const song = response.data;

// If the record has no associated file, we can return early.
if (!song?.coverArtPath) return;

const updatedSong = await client.models.Song.update({
  id: song.id,
  coverArtPath: null,
});
```
</InlineFilter>

### Remove the record association and delete the file

    return
}

guard let coverArtPath = song.coverArtPath else {
    print("There is no cover art path to remove image association")
    return
}

// Set the association to nil and update it
song.coverArtPath = nil
let updatedSong = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(song)).get()

// Remove the image
try await Amplify.Storage.remove(path: .fromString(coverArtPath))
```

const client = generateClient<Schema>({
  authMode: "apiKey",
});
const response = await client.models.Song.get({
  id: currentSong.id,

  id: song.id,
  coverArtPath: null,
});

// Delete the file from S3:
await remove({ path: song.coverArtPath });

```
</InlineFilter>

### Delete both file and record

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
```swift title="ContentView"
// Get the song record

    return
}

if let coverArt = song.coverArtPath {
    // Delete the file from S3
    try await Amplify.Storage.remove(path: .fromString(coverArt))
}

if (!song?.coverArtPath) return;

await remove({ path: song.coverArtPath });

// Delete the record from the API:
await client.models.Song.delete({ id: song.id });

```
</InlineFilter>

## Working with multiple files

You may want to add multiple files to a single record, such as a user profile with multiple images. To do this, you can add a list of file keys to the record. The following example adds a list of file keys to a record:

### GraphQL schema to associate a data model with multiple files

Add the following model in `amplify/data/resource.ts" file.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
const schema = a.schema({
  PhotoAlbum: a
    .model({
      id: a.id().required(),
      name: a.string().required(),
      imagePaths: a.string().array(),
    })
    .authorization((allow) => [allow.publicApiKey()]),
});
```

CRUD operations when working with multiple files is the same as when working with a single file, with the exception that we are now working with a list of image keys, as opposed to a single image key.

### Create a record with multiple associated files

First create a record via the GraphQL API, then upload the files to Storage, and finally add the associations between the record and files.

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>
```swift title="ContentView"
// Create the photo album record
let album = PhotoAlbum(name: name)
var createdAlbum = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(album)).get()

// Upload the photo album images
let imagePaths = await withTaskGroup(of: String?.self) { group in
    for imageData in imagesData {
        group.addTask {
            let path = "images/\(album.id)-\(UUID().uuidString)"
            do {
                _ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(path: .fromString(path), data: imageData).value
                return path
            } catch {
                print("Failed with error:", error)
                return nil
            }
        }
    }

    var imagePaths: [String?] = []
    for await imagePath in group {
        imagePaths.append(imagePath)
    }
    return imagePaths.compactMap { $0 }

### Delete and remove files associated with API records

The workflow for deleting and removing files associated with API records is the same as when working with a single file, except that when performing a delete you will need to iterate over the list of file paths and call `Storage.remove()` for each file.

#### Remove the file association, continue to persist both files and record

## Data consistency when working with records and files

The recommended access patterns in these docs attempt to remove deleted files, but favor leaving orphans over leaving records that point to non-existent files. This optimizes for read latency by ensuring clients _rarely_ attempt to fetch a non-existent file from Storage. However, any app that deletes files can inherently cause records _on-device_ to point to non-existent files.

One example is when we [create an API record, associate the Storage file with that record, and then retrieve the file's signed URL](#create-a-record-with-an-associated-file). "Device A" calls the GraphQL API to create `API_Record_1`, and then associates that record with `First_Photo`. Before "Device A" is about to retrieve the signed URL, "Device B" might query `API_Record_1`, delete `First_Photo`, and update the record accordingly. However, "Device A" is still using the old `API_Record_1`, which is now out-of-date. Even though the shared global state is correctly in sync at every stage, the individual device ("Device A") has an out-of-date record that points to a non-existent file. Similar issues can conceivably occur for updates. Depending on your app, some of these mismatches can be minimized _even more_ with [real-time data / GraphQL subscriptions](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/subscribe-data/).

It is important to understand when these mismatches can occur and to add meaningful error handling around these cases. This guide does not include exhaustive error handling, real-time subscriptions, re-querying of outdated records, or attempts to retry failed operations. However, these are all important considerations for a production-level application.
