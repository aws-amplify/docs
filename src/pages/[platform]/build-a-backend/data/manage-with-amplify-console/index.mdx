The **Data manager** page in the Amplify Console offers a user-friendly interface for managing the backend GraphQL API data of an application. It enables real-time creation and updates of application data, eliminating the need to build separate admin views.

If you have not yet created a **data** resource, visit the [Data setup guide](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/set-up-data/).
