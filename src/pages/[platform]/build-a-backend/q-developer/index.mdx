[Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) re-imagines the experience across the entire Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC), making it faster and easier for developers and IT professionals to explore and understand problems and codebase, plan and develop a solution, build and deploy their apps, or modernize legacy workloads. Q Developer in the IDE provides [Inline completions (former Amazon CodeWhisperer)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/what-is-cwspr.html) - an AI-powered productivity tool that generates code suggestions ranging from snippets to full functions in real time in the IDE based on your comments and existing code. When you start typing out singles of code or comments, Inline completions
makes suggestions based on your current and previous inputs. 

<Callout informational>

**Note:** AWS recommends that, before using Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions, you disable any other extensions that provide code completion functionality.

## Setting up Q Developer

You can use Q Developer through [AWS Toolkit for VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/welcome.html) or [AWS Toolkit for JetBrains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/welcome.html)

### Installing or updating your IDE 

To install VS Code for the first time, use the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). If you already have VS Code installed, update to the latest version as follows:

- On MacOS, choose Code -> **Check for Updates**.
- On Windows and Linux, choose Help -> **Check for Updates**.

To install JetBrains for the first time, use the [JetBrains download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). If you already have JetBrains installed, update to the latest version as follows:

- On MacOS, from the IDE's main dropdown menu, choose **Check for Updates**.
- On Windows and Linux, choose Help -> **Check for Updates**.

### Installing the AWS Toolkit

In order to use Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions with VS Code or JetBrains, you must first download and install the AWS Toolkit.

For information about installing the AWS Toolkit for VS Code, see [Setting Up the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/setting-up.html) in the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code user guide.

For information about installing the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains, see [Setting Up the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-jetbrains/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) in the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains user guide.

### Choosing your authentication method

If you plan to use Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions with VS Code (through AWS Toolkit) or JetBrains (through AWS Toolkit), you will have to authenticate using either AWS Builder ID or IAM Identity Center.

If you plan to use Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions with AWS Cloud9 AWS Lambda, SageMaker Studio, JupyterLab, or AWS Glue Studio, you will have to authenticate using IAM.

For information about authenticating with Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions, see [Authenticating with Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions and AWS Toolkit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/whisper-setup-ide-devs.html#codewhisperer-auth).


### Setting up your authentication method

- [Builder ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/sign-in-aws_builder_id.html) (used with AWS Toolkit and VS Code or JetBrains) requires only an email address. To use it, you don't even need an AWS account.
- [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html) requires setup by your enterprise administrator.
- [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) credentials are used within your AWS account to regulate access to, and between, various AWS services.

To access AWS, you must sign up for an [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/latest/userguide/setting-up.html#getting-started-signup)

## Use Q Developer - Inline completions in your Gen 2 project

Amplify generates two folders in our backend directory, `auth` and `data` which contain TypeScript CDK definitions for each of these resources.  Weâ€™ll build out the schema for our API through the help of Amazon Q Developer - Inline completions capabilities.

**Step 1:** Open `amplify/data/resource.ts` and comment out the default schema for Todo provided.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

// ...

// const schema = a.schema({
//   Todo: a
//     .model({
//       content: a.string(),
//     })
//     .authorization([a.allow.public()]),
// });

// ...
```

**Step 2:** In a new line below the commented schema, enter a comment to generate the schema using natural language. For example, `generate a restaurant model with the following fields: id, name, description, address, image, rating, style. Rating can be a float value. Authorization should allow public.`  Press `Enter` for a new line and wait for Amazon Q Developer to generate Inline completion for your schema.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

// ...

// const schema = a.schema({
//   Todo: a
//     .model({
//       content: a.string(),
//     })
//     .authorization([a.allow.public()]),
// });

// highlight-start
// generate a restaurant model with the following fields: id, name, description, address, image, rating, style. Rating can be a float value. Authorization should allow public.
// highlight-end

// ...
```

**Step 3:** Select the Inline completion generated by Amazon Q developer. The Inline completion feature assists you in defining the schema
and hover over the output to select from other options.

<Callout informational>

**Note:** You can also trigger Inline completion feature by invoking Amazon Q Developer manually using Option+C keyboard shortcut in VS Code. For more commands, please refer to the Commands tab in the AWS Toolkit extension.

**Step 4:** Make any required changes to the schema and save the `amplify/data/resource.ts` file. This will trigger a sandbox deployment and your new data model will be deployed
