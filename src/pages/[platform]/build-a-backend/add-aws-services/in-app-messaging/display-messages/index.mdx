In-app messages are displayed when an In-App Messaging or analytics event is sent and matches the criteria defined by your active In-App Messaging campaigns.

## Analytics event

Now that messages have been synced to your users' devices, Amplify In-App Messaging will allow you to start displaying them with Amplify Analytics events with no additional integration steps. Any events you record or are already recording using the Analytics' `record` API are automatically picked up and processed by In-App Messaging. If the event matches the attributes and criteria defined in an in-app message, that message will be displayed.

```js title="src/index.js"
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({
  name: 'first_event',
  attributes: { color: 'red' },
  metrics: { quantity: 10 }
});
```

If the event name, attributes, and metrics match those set forth by one of your In-App Messaging campaigns, you should see the in-app message displayed in your app.

## In-App Messaging event

In addition to or instead of Amplify Analytics events, you can also dispatch In-App Messaging events to trigger an in-app message display programmatically.

```js title="src/index.js"
import { dispatchEvent } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';

dispatchEvent({
  name: 'first_event',
  attributes: { color: 'red' },
  metrics: { quantity: 10 }
});
```

If the event name, attributes, and metrics match those set forth by one of your In-App Messaging campaigns, you should see the in-app message displayed in your app.
