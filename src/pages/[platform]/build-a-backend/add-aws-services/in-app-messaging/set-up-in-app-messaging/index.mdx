Amplify allows interacting with In-App Messaging APIs, enabling you to send messages to your app users. In-App Messaging is a powerful tool to engage with your users and provide them with relevant information. 
A campaign is a messaging initiative that engages a specific audience segment. A campaign sends tailored messages according to a schedule that you define. You can use the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) to create a campaign that sends messages through any single channel that is supported by Amazon Pinpoint: Mobile Push, In-App, Email, SMS or Custom channels.

The following is an example utilizing the AWS CDK to create the In-App Messaging resource powered by [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/). Note: there are no official hand-written (L2) constructs for this service yet.

<Callout informational>

**Note:** Campaign start time must be at least 15 minutes in future. In-app messages can only be synced to local device once the campaign becomes active (Status should be "In Progress" in the campaigns screen of the Pinpoint console).

## Install Amplify Libraries

First, install the `aws-amplify` library:

```sh title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm add aws-amplify
```

### Initialize In-App Messaging

To finish setting up your application with Amplify, you need to configure it using the `configure` API. Next, to interact with In-App Messaging APIs, you need to first initialize In-App Messaging by calling the `initializeInAppMessaging` API directly imported from the `in-app-messaging` sub-path. This is required to be called as early as possible in the app lifecycle.

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "angular", "react", "vue", "react-native"]}>
```js title="src/index.js"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { initializeInAppMessaging } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
initializeInAppMessaging();
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['nextjs']}> 
```js title="index.tsx"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { initializeInAppMessaging } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';
import outputs from '@/amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
initializeInAppMessaging();
```
</InlineFilter>

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your application’s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.
