AWS Amplify Interactions enables AI-powered chatbots in your web or mobile apps. You can use _Interactions_ to configure your backend chatbot provider and to integrate a chatbot UI into your app with just a single line of code.

## Interactions with AWS

AWS Amplify supports [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex) as the default chatbots service. Amazon Lex supports creating conversational bots with the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa.

## Setup AWS LexV2 bot

You can create an Amazon Lex V2 chatbot in Amazon Lex console. To create your bot, follow the steps shown in [Amazon Lex V2 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

![Amazon Lex intents page with a bot called 'BookTripNew', showing a list of two created intents 'BookCar' and 'FallbackIntent' that your users want to accomplish like booking a car](/images/interactions_lex_v2_console_edit_bot.png)

## Update your IAM Policy

Amazon Lex service requires an IAM policy in order to use the interactions APIs (_remember to replace the template with real value_):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["lex:RecognizeText", "lex:RecognizeUtterance"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lex:<your-app-region>:<your-account-id>:bot-alias/<your-bot-id>/<your-bot-alias-id>"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configure your frontend

<InlineFilter filters={['javascript','angular','nextjs','react','vue' ]}>
Add the aws-amplify and interactions package to your project:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false} 
npm add --save @aws-amplify/interactions aws-amplify
```

### Install Amplify and its dependencies

<Accordion title="Instructions for React Native version 0.72 and below">

  `@aws-amplify/react-native` requires a minimum iOS deployment target of `13.0` if you are using `react-native` version less than or equal to `0.72`. Open the _Podfile_ located in the _ios_ directory and update the `target` value:

  ```diff
   - platform :ios, min_ios_version_supported
   + platform :ios, 13.0
   ```

</Accordion>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false} 
npm add aws-amplify \
  @aws-amplify/react-native \
  @aws-amplify/interactions \
  @react-native-community/netinfo \
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage \
  react-native-get-random-values
```
</InlineFilter>

<Callout>

Make sure that the `@aws-amplify/interactions` package has the same version number as the `aws-amplify` package in your `package.json` file.

</Callout>

### Configure Amplify
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example, **App.js** (Expo) or **index.js** (React Native CLI).

```javascript title="src/index.js"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
Amplify.configure({
  ...Amplify.getConfig(),
  Interactions: {
    LexV2: {
      '<your-bot-name>': {
        aliasId: '<your-bot-alias-id>',
        botId: '<your-bot-id>',
        localeId: '<your-bot-locale-id>',
        region: '<your-bot-region>'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>
You need to add the `crypto.getRandomValues` polyfills to your application's entry point file (in most React Native apps this will be the top level index.js).

```js title="src/index.js"
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```
</InlineFilter>

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your application’s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the [Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide](/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/library-not-configured/) for possible causes of this issue.
