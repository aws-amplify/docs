In this guide, you will learn how to set up Geo in your Amplify project. You will set up your backend resources, manage their access, and integrate geo maps, place indices, and geofence collections within your application.

If you have not yet created an Amplify project, visit the [quickstart guide](/[platform]/start/quickstart/).

Amazon Location Services now offers independent APIs and UI components for maps and location search for your web apps, eliminating the need to provision these resources. You can add maps, location search (place index), and geofencing functionality to your app in just a few lines of code. Learn more about these resources [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/what-is.html).

## Building your Geo backend

First, create a file `amplify/geo/resource.ts` within your Amplify project. This file will be the location to configure your Geo backend resources. This entails managing access to maps and location search and provisioning geofence collections. For example, you can instantiate a geofence collection, place index, or a map resource by using the `defineMap`, `definePlace`, or `defineCollection` functions and providing a `name` for these resources. 

```ts title="amplify/geo/resource.ts"
import {
  defineMap,
  defineCollection,
  definePlace,
} from '@aws-amplify/backend-geo';

export const map = defineMap({
  name: 'amplifyMap',
});

export const place = definePlace({
  name: 'amplifyPlaceIndex',
});

export const collection = defineCollection({
  name: 'amplifyCollection'
});
```

Now, import these resource definitions within your `amplify/backend.ts` file that contains your backend definition. Add these Geo resources to `defineBackend`.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
// highlight-next-line
import { map, place, collection } from './geo/resource.js';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  // highlight-start
  map,
  place,
  collection,
  // highlight-end
});
```

To deploy these resources to your cloud sandbox, run the CLI command in your terminal:
<InlineFilter filters={["react", "angular", "javascript", "vue", "nextjs", "react-native"]}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox
```

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["android"]}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-out-dir <path_to_app/src/main/res/raw/>
```

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-out-dir <path_to_swift_project>
```

</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={["flutter"]}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format dart --outputs-out-dir lib
```

</InlineFilter>

This command will deploy a Geofence Collection to your cloud sandbox and generate access policies to integrate the map and location search resources with your Amplify project.

## Define resource access permissions

All maps, place indices, and geofence collections requested by Amplify Geo are inaccessible by users or other resources by default. Access to these resources must be explicitly granted within the `access` callback of the `defineMap`, `definePlace`, and `defineCollection` functions. Refer to [this](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/geo/custom-authorization/) page to learn more about access customization and possible access actions.

The following example shows you how you can set up your map and collection access structure for authorized and guest users.

1. Guests only have access to read into and list geofence collections. 
2. Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete geofence collections while also being able to access the static ma managed by AWS.

```ts title="amplify/geo/resource.ts"
export const map = defineMap({
  name: 'amplifyMap',
  access: (allow) => [
    allow.authenticated.to(['get'])
  ],
});

export const collection = defineCollection({
  name: 'amplifyCollection',
  access: (allow) => [
    allow.authenticated.to(['create', 'read', 'update', 'delete']),
    allow.guest.to(['read', 'list']),
  ],
});
```

<InlineFilter filters={['javascript', "angular", "react", "vue", "react-native", "nextjs"]}>

<Callout warning="true">

AWS Location API keys currently do not support geofence collections or their associated APIs. Adding acesss definitions for any API keys using the `allow.apiKey.to()` definition will NOT result in the creation of an API key.

</Callout>

## Generate API Keys

You can use AWS Location API keys to authenticate and authorize anonymous users to use Geo resources. Refer to the [Amazon Location documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/access.html) to learn more about authentication with API keys.

To generate API keys for your map and location resources, you can configure their generation during resource instantiation.

```ts title="amplify/geo/resource.ts"
export const map = defineMap({
  name: 'amplifyMap',
  access: (allow) => [
    allow.authenticated.to(['get'])
    // highlight-next-line
    allow.apiKey.to(['get'])
  ],
  // highlight-start
  apiKeyProps: {
    apiKeyName: 'testMapKey',
    noExpiry: true
  }
  // highlight-end
});

export const collection = defineCollection({
  name: 'amplifyCollection',
  access: (allow) => [
    allow.authenticated.to(['search', 'geocode', 'autocomplete']),
    allow.guest.to(['search']),
    // highlight-next-line
    allow.apiKey.to(['search', 'geocode'])
  ],
  // highlight-start
  apiKeyProps: {
    apiKeyName: 'testIndexKey',
    noExpiry: false
  }
  // highlight-end
});
```

This will generate AWS Location API keys configured with the restrictions provided in the `access` block. The names of all provisioned API keys will then appear in the `amplify_outputs.json` file. To access their hidden values through AWS CLI, refer to the instructions below. You can also view the hidden value of your key through the AWS Location Services Console.

Install the latest version of the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure it with your AWS account.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
aws location describe-key \
    --key-name <your-key-name>
```

<Callout>
**Note:** To access information about generated API keys, you must ensure that `geo:DescribeKey` access is granted to your user roles and resources. learn more about setting up access for Location resources [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/set-up.html).
</Callout>

## Configure your application

To display a map in your application, you can use the [Amplify React MapView component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/geo) or the [MapLibre GL](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) with `maplibre-gl-js-amplify` libraries are required.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/geo
```

> **Note:** Make sure that version `6.0.0` or above is installed.

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point.

<InlineFilter filters={['javascript', "angular", "react", "vue", "react-native"]}>

```javascript title="pages/_app.js"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '@/amplify_outputs.json';

```

</InlineFilter>

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.
