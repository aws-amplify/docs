When determining the authorization mode for your REST endpoint, there are a few customizations you can do.

## IAM Authorization

By default, the API will be using IAM authorization and the requests will be signed for you automatically. IAM authorization has two modes: one using an **unauthenticated** role, and one using an **authenticated** role. When the user has not signed in, the unauthenticated role is used by default. Once the user has signed in, the authenticate role is used, instead.

## API Key

If you want to configure a public REST API, you can set an API key in Amazon API Gateway or create one using the [CDK construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway.ApiKey.html). Then, you can set the API key header in the API configuration which will be applied to all requests.

```ts
Amplify.configure(outputs, {
  API: {
    REST: {
      headers: async () => {
        return { 'X-Api-Key': apiKey };
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Cognito User Pool Authorization

You can use the access token from configured Cognito User Pool to authenticate against REST endpoint. The JWT token can be retrieved from the `Auth` category.

```ts
import { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth'

const session = await fetchAuthSession();
const token = session.tokens?.idToken
```

Then you need to set the Authorization header in the API category configuration. The following example shows how to set the Authorization header for all requests.

```ts
Amplify.configure(outputs, {
  API: {
    REST: {
      headers: async () => {
        return { Authorization: authToken };
      }
    }
  }
});
```

For more details on how to configure the API Gateway with the custom authorization, see [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html)

### Note related to use of Access Token or ID Token

The ID Token contains claims about the identity of the authenticated user such as name, email, and phone_number. On the Amplify Authentication category you can retrieve the Id Token using:

```ts
const session = await fetchAuthSession();
const token = session.tokens?.idToken
```

The Access Token contains scopes and groups and is used to grant access to authorized resources. [This is a tutorial for enabling custom scopes](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cognito-custom-scopes-api-gateway/). You can retrieve the Access Token using

```textSpanIntersectsWith
const session = await fetchAuthSession();
const token = session.tokens?.accessToken
```

## Custom Authorization Token

If you want to use a custom authorization token, you can set the token in the API category configuration. The custom authorization token will be applied to all requests.

```ts
Amplify.configure(outputs, {
  API: {
    REST: {
      headers: async () => {
        return { Authorization: customAuthToken };
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Setting Authorization Headers per Request

Alternatively, you can set the authorization headers per request. For example, if you want to use a custom header named `Authorization` for a specific REST request, you can set the following configuration:

```ts
async function updateItem() {
  await del({
    apiName: 'myRestApi',
    path: 'items/1',
    options: {
      headers: {
        Authorization: authToken
      }
    }
  }).response;
}
```
