Amplify provides provides a solution for using AI and ML cloud services to enhance your application. Some supported use cases:
<ul>
<li>

</ul>

Predictions is broadly organized into 3 key use cases - Identify, Convert, and Interpret - which are available in the client API as well as CLI workflows.
<ul>
<li>
`Identify` will find text (words, tables, pages from a book), entities (faces and/or celebrities) from images. You can also identify real world landmarks or objects such as chairs, desks, etc. which are referred to as “labels” from images.
</li>
<li>
`Convert` allows you to translate text from one source language to a target language. You can also generate speech audio from text input. Lastly, you can take an audio input and transcribe it using a websocket stream.
</li>
<li>
`Interpret` allows you to analyze text for language, entities (places, people), key phrases, sentiment (positive, neutral, negative), and syntax (pronouns, verbs, adjectives).
</li>
</ul>
Some common use cases are listed below, as well as an advanced workflow which allows you to perform dynamic image indexing from a connected s3 bucket.

Predictions comes with built-in support for [Amazon Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is-transcribe.html), [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/what-is.html), and [Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html).
