## Working with the API

You can transcribe a PCM Audio byte buffer to Text, such as a recording from microphone.

```ts
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const { transcription } = await Predictions.convert({
  transcription: {
    source: {
      bytes
    }
  }
})
```

To view the complete list of all the supported languages and language specific features refer to [the supported languages list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html). The language data input type has to support streaming for it to work with Amplify Predictions.
