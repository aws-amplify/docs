In this guide, you will learn how to set up storage in your Amplify app. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources and enabling file uploads, downloads, and list features.

If you have not yet created an Amplify app, visit the [quickstart guide](/[platform]/start/quickstart/).

## Building your storage backend

By defining storage in your backend configuration, you can customize the access rules to different paths in your storage bucket.

First, create a file `amplify/storage/resource.ts`. Paste the following content into the file.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles'
});
```

Then include storage in your backend definition.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
// highlight-next-line
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  // highlight-next-line
  storage
});
```

Now when you run `npx amplify sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will configure an S3 bucket where the files will be uploaded to and downloaded from.

Before files can be accessed by your application, you must configure storage access rules.

### Define File Prefix Access

By default, no users or other project resources have access to any files in the storage bucket. Access must be explicitly granted within `defineStorage` using the `access` callback.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    // highlight-next-line
    'some/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/some/path/*" go here
    ],
    // highlight-next-line
    'another/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/another/path/*" go here
    ]
  })
});
```

The access callback returns an object where each key in the object is a file prefix and each value in the object is a list of access rules that apply to that prefix. 

Refer to the following example to construct access rules for your storage bucket or you can copy paste to test it out. [Learn more about customizing access to file prefixes](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'authenticated_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'user_protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'guest_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.guest.to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```
Copy and paste the following definition for authorization rules to implement public, protected, and private prefixes (this is currently the pattern in Gen 1).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'public/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read']),
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'private/{entity_id}/*': [allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])]
  })
});
```
## Connect your app code to the storage backend

Amplify Storage library provides client APIs that connect to the backend resources you defined.

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `index.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```
<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.

</Callout>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the Set up Amplify Storage guide. In this guide, you set up and connected to backend resources, customized your file prefixes and access definitions, and connected your application to the backend to implement features like file uploads and downloads.

### Next steps

Now that you have completed setting up storage in your Amplify app, you can proceed to add file management features to your app. You can access the following links to jump to upload and download functionality or access to more capabilities from the sidebar under storage.
