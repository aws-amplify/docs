**Under active development:** The Storage experience for Amplify Gen 2 is under active development. The experience may change between versions of `@aws-amplify/backend`. Try it out and provide feedback at https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-backend/issues/new/choose

By defining storage in your backend configuration, you can customize the access rules to different paths in your storage bucket.

First, create a file `amplify/storage/resource.ts`. Paste the following content into the file.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles'
});
```

Then include storage in your backend definition.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
// highlight-next-line
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  // highlight-next-line
  storage
});
```

Now when you run `npx amplify sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will configure an S3 bucket where the files will be uploaded to and downloaded from.

Before files can be accessed by your application, you must configure storage access rules.

## Define File Prefix Access

By default, no users or other project resources have access to any files in the storage bucket. Access must be explicitly granted within `defineStorage` using the `access` callback.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    // highlight-next-line
    'some/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/some/path/*" go here
    ],
    // highlight-next-line
    'another/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/another/path/*" go here
    ]
  })
});
```

The access callback returns an object where each key in the object is a file prefix and each value in the object is a list of access rules that apply to that prefix. 

Refer to the following example to construct access rules for your storage bucket or you can copy paste to test it out. [Learn more about customizing access to file prefixes](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'authenticated_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'user_protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'guest_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.guest.to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```
Copy paste the following template for authorization rules to implement public, protected, and private prefixes (this is currently the pattern in Gen 1).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'public/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read'])
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'private/{entity_id}/*': [allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])]
  })
});
```
