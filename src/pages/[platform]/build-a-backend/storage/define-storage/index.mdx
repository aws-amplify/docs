By defining storage in your backend configuration, you can customize the access rules to different paths in your storage bucket.

First, create a file `amplify/storage/resource.ts`. Paste the following content into the file.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles'
});
```

Then include storage in your backend definition.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
// highlight-next-line
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  // highlight-next-line
  storage
});
```

Now when you run `npx amplify sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will configure an S3 bucket where the files will be uploaded to and downloaded from.

Before files can be accessed by your application, you must configure storage access rules.

## Define File Prefix Access

By default, no users or other project resources have access to any files in the storage bucket. Access must be explicitly granted within `defineStorage` using the `access` callback.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    // highlight-next-line
    'some/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/some/path/*" go here
    ],
    // highlight-next-line
    'another/path/*': [
      // access rules that apply to all files within "/another/path/*" go here
    ]
  })
});
```

The access callback returns an object where each key in the object is a file prefix and each value in the object is a list of access rules that apply to that prefix. 

Refer to the following example to construct access rules for your storage bucket or you can copy paste to test it out. [Learn more about customizing access to file prefixes](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'authenticated_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'user_protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'guest_access_only/*': [
      // highlight-next-line
      allow.guest.to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```
Copy paste the following template for authorization rules to implement public, protected, and private prefixes (this is currently the pattern in Gen 1).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'public/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read'])
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'private/{entity_id}/*': [allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])]
  })
});
```
### Amazon S3 Bucket CORS Policy Setup

{/* TODO Rewrite is this needed only for JS? or is it needed for Flutter Web for example as well? */}

<Callout warning>

To make calls to your S3 bucket from your App, you need to set up a CORS Policy for your S3 bucket. This callout is only for manual configuration of your S3 bucket.

</Callout>

The following steps will set up your CORS Policy:

1. Go to [Amazon S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1) and click on your project's `userfiles` bucket, which is normally named as [Bucket Name][Id]-dev. ![Go to [Amazon S3 Console]](/images/storage/CORS1.png)
2. Click on the **Permissions** tab for your bucket. ![Click on the **Permissions** tab for your bucket](/images/storage/CORS2.png)
3. Click the edit button in the **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** section. ![Click the edit button in the **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** section](/images/storage/CORS3.png)
4. Make the Changes and click on Save Changes. You can add required metadata to be exposed in `ExposeHeaders` with `x-amz-meta-XXXX` format. ![Click on Save Changes:](/images/storage/CORS4.png)

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
      "x-amz-request-id",
      "x-amz-id-2",
      "ETag",
      "x-amz-meta-foo"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

<Callout>

**Note:** You can restrict the access to your bucket by updating AllowedOrigin to include individual domains.
