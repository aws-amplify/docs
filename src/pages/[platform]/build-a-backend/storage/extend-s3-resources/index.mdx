## For Amplify-generated S3 resources

Amplify Storage generates Amazon S3 resources to offer storage features. You can access the underlying Amazon S3 resources to further customize your backend configuration by using the AWS Cloud Developer Kit (CDK).

### Example - Enable Transfer Acceleration

The following is an example of how you would enable Transfer Acceleration on the bucket ([CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_s3.CfnBucket.AccelerateConfigurationProperty.html)). In order to enable Transfer Acceleration on the bucket, you will have to unwrap the L1 CDK construct from the L2 CDK construct like the following.

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

const backend = defineBackend({
  storage
});

// highlight-start
const s3Bucket = backend.storage.resources.bucket;

const cfnBucket = s3Bucket.node.defaultChild as s3.CfnBucket;

cfnBucket.accelerateConfiguration = {
  accelerationStatus: "Enabled" // 'Suspended' if you want to disable transfer acceleration
}
// highlight-end
```

### For Manually configured S3 resources

{/* TODO Rewrite is this needed only for JS? or is it needed for Flutter Web for example as well? */}

<Callout warning>

To make calls to your S3 bucket from your App, you need to set up a CORS Policy for your S3 bucket. This callout is only for manual configuration of your S3 bucket.

</Callout>

The following steps will set up your CORS Policy:

1. Go to [Amazon S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1) and click on your project's `userfiles` bucket, which is normally named as [Bucket Name][Id]-dev. ![Go to [Amazon S3 Console]](/images/storage/CORS1.png)
2. Click on the **Permissions** tab for your bucket. ![Click on the **Permissions** tab for your bucket](/images/storage/CORS2.png)
3. Click the edit button in the **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** section. ![Click the edit button in the **Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)** section](/images/storage/CORS3.png)
4. Make the Changes and click on Save Changes. You can add required metadata to be exposed in `ExposeHeaders` with `x-amz-meta-XXXX` format. ![Click on Save Changes:](/images/storage/CORS4.png)

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": [
      "x-amz-server-side-encryption",
      "x-amz-request-id",
      "x-amz-id-2",
      "ETag",
      "x-amz-meta-foo"
    ],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

<Callout>

**Note:** You can restrict the access to your bucket by updating AllowedOrigin to include individual domains.
