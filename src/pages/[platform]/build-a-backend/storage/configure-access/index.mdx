<Callout warning>
We recommend using the new [Amplify Gen2](https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/build-a-backend/storage/) experience when defining file access permissions as it offers a more flexible approach to customize access to files.

Note: `accessLevel` parameter is deprecated and maybe removed in next major version.
</Callout>

Storage module can manage files with three different access levels; `guest`, `protected` and `private`. The Amplify CLI configures three different access levels on the storage bucket: guest, protected and private. When you run `amplify add storage`, the CLI will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using a Cognito identity pool Role. You will have the option of adding CRUD (Create/Update, Read and Delete) based permissions as well, so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted limited permissions within these levels.

If you had previously enabled user sign-in by running `amplify add auth` in your project, the policies will be connected to an `Authenticated Role` of the identity pool which has scoped permission to the objects in the bucket for each user identity. If you haven't configured user sign-in, then an `Unauthenticated Role` will be assigned for each unique user/device combination, which still has scoped permissions to just their objects.

- Guest: Accessible by all users of your app. Files are stored under the `public/` path in your S3 bucket.
- Protected: Readable by all users, but writable only by the creating user. Files are stored under `protected/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.
- Private: Only accessible for the individual user. Files are stored under `private/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

When using Auth and Storage modules together, you do not need to construct the `/{user_identity_id}/` manually as the library will use the configured Cognito Identity ID for your user/device along with the configured access level for an action. This includes UnAuthenticated access where you will first call `fetchAuthSession` before a Storage action. See [Authentication](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/under-the-hood/) for more information.

The access level can be configured on the Storage object globally. Alternatively, the access levels can be set in individual function calls.

> Default access level for Storage module is `guest`. Unless you configure Storage otherwise, all uploaded files will be publicly available for all users.

Access level configuration on the Storage object:

```javascript
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

await getUrl({ key: 'welcome.png', options: { level: 'guest' } }); // Gets welcome.png in public space
```

The default access level is `guest`:

```javascript
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

await getUrl({ key: 'welcome.png' }); // Get welcome.png in public space
```

## Customization (Deprecated)

### Customize Object Key Path (Deprecated)

You can customize your key path by defining a prefix resolver:

```javascript
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig, {
  Storage: {
    S3: {
      prefixResolver: async ({ accessLevel, targetIdentityId }) => {
        if (accessLevel === 'guest') {
          return 'myPublicPrefix/';
        } else if (accessLevel === 'protected') {
          return `myProtectedPrefix/${targetIdentityId}/`;
        } else {
          return `myPrivatePrefix/${targetIdentityId}/`;
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

For example, if you want to enable read, write and delete operation for all the objects under path _myPublicPrefix/_, declare it in your IAM policy:

```json
"Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:DeleteObject"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/myPublicPrefix/*",
    ]
  }
]
```

If you want to have custom _private_ path prefix like _myPrivatePrefix/_, you need to add it into your IAM policy:

```xml
"Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:DeleteObject"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::your-s3-bucket/myPrivatePrefix/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/*"
    ]
  }
]
```

This ensures only the authenticated users has the access to the objects under the path.
