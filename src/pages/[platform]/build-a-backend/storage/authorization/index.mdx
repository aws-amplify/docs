Customize authorization for your storage bucket by defining access individually to file prefixes for Guest, Authenticated, and group users. Access can also be defined for functions that require access to the storage bucket.

Refer to the following examples to understand how you can further customize authorization against different user types.

## Access Types

**Note:** Prefixes cannot have a '/' at the beginning of the string.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Guest Users">
To grant all guest (i.e. not signed in) users of your application read access to files that start with `media/*`, use the following `access` values.

Note that your backend must include `defineAuth` in order to use this access rule.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read']) // additional actions such as "write" and "delete" can be specified depending on your use case
    ]
  })
});
```

</Block>
<Block name="Authenticated Users">
To grant all authenticated (i.e. signed in) users of your application read access to files that start with `media/*`, use the following `access` configuration.

Note that your backend must include `defineAuth` in order to use this access rule.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']) // additional actions such as "write" and "delete" can be specified depending on your use case
    ]
  })
});
```

</Block>
<Block name="User Groups">
If you have configured user groups in `defineAuth`, you can scope storage access to specific groups. Suppose you have a `defineAuth` config with `admin` and `auditor` groups.

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  },
  groups: ['admin', 'auditor']
});
```

With the following `access` definition, you can configure permissions such that auditors have readonly permissions to `media/*` while admin has full permissions.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [
      allow.groups(['friends']).to(['read']),
      allow.groups(['admin']).to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```

If multiple groups require the same set of actions, this can be combined into a single rule.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [
      allow.groups(['friends', 'admin']).to(['read', 'write'])
    ]
  })
});
```

</Block>
<Block name="Owners">
Access to files with a certain prefix can be scoped down to individual authenticated users. 

To do this, a placeholder token i.e. `entity_id`, is used in the storage path which will be substituted with the user identity when uploading or downloading files. The access rule will only allow a user to upload or download files with their specific identity string.

`entity_id` represents the the ID of the entity that is being used to scope files. Currently, only Identity Pool is supported and hence, files can be scoped to `identity_id` of users.

Note that your backend must include `defineAuth` in order to use this access rule.

The following policy would allow authenticated users full access to `media/` that matches their identity id.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/{entity_id}/*': [
      // {entity_id} is the token that is replaced with the user identity id
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```

A user with identity id `user123` would be able to perform read/write/delete operations on files within `media/user123/*` and would not be able to perform actions on files with any other prefix.

Likewise, a user with identity ID `userABC` would be able to perform read/write/delete operation on files only within `media/userABC/*`. In this way, each user can be granted access to a "private storage location" that is not accessible to any other user.

It may be desireable for a file owner to be able to write and delete files in their private location but allow anyone to read from that location. For example, profile pictures should be readable by anyone, but only the owner can modify them. This use case can be configured with the following definition.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/profile-pictures/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
      allow.guest.to(['read']),
      allow.authenticated.to(['read'])
    ]
  })
});
```

When a non-ID-based rule is applied to a path with the `{entity_id}` token, the token is replaced with a wildcard (`*`). This means that the access will apply to files uploaded by _any_ user. In the above policy, write and delete is scoped to just the owner, but read is allowed for guest and authenticated users for any file within `media/profile-pictures/*/*`.

</Block>
<Block name="Functions">
In addition to granting application users access to storage files, you may also want to grant a backend function access to storage files. This could be used to enable a use case like resizing images, or automatically deleting old files. The following configuration is used to define function access.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage, defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const demoFunction = defineFunction({});

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [allow.resource(demoFunction).to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])]
  })
});
```

This would grant the function `demoFunction` the ability to read write and delete files within `media/*`.

When a function is granted access to storage, it also receives an environment variable that contains the name of the S3 bucket configured by storage. This environment variable can be used in the function to make SDK calls to the storage bucket. The environment variable is named `<storage-name>_BUCKET_NAME`. In the above example, it would be named `myProjectFiles_BUCKET_NAME`.

### Access definition rules

There are some rules on the types of prefixes that can be specified in the storage access definition.

1. All paths must end with `/*`. This is because all paths are treated as prefixes from the storage root.
2. Only one level of nesting is allowed. For example, you can define access controls on `media/*` and `media/albums/*` but not on `media/albums/photos/*` because that path has 2 other prefixes.
3. Wildcards cannot conflict with the `{entity_id}` token. For example, you cannot have both `media/*` and `media/{entity_id}/*` defined because the wildcard in the first path conflicts with the `{entity_id}` token in the second path.
4. A path cannot be a prefix of another path with an `{entity_id}` token. For example `media/*` and `media/albums/{entity_id}/*` is not allowed.

### Prefix behavior

When one path is a subpath of another, the permissions on the subpath _always override_ the permissions from the parent path. Permissions are not "inherited" from a parent path. Consider the following access definition example.

```ts
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'media/*': [allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])],
    'media/profile-pictures/*': [allow.guest.to(['read'])],
    'media/albums/*': [allow.authenticated.to(['read'])],
    'other/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read']),
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write'])
    ]
  })
});
```

The access control matrix for this configuration is

|  | media/\* | media/profile-pictures/\* | media/albums/\* | other/\* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Authenticated Users** | read, write, delete | NONE | read | read, write |
| **Guest users** | NONE | read | NONE | read |

Authenticated users have access to read, write, and delete everything under `media/*` EXCEPT `media/profile-pictures/*` and `media/albums/*`. For those subpaths, the scoped down access overrides the access granted on the parent `media/*`

### Available actions

When you configure access to a particular storage prefix, you can scope the access to one or more CRUDL actions.

| Access   | Corresponding Library APIs                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `read`   | `getUrl`, `downloadData`, `list`, and `getProperties` |
| `get`    | `getUrl` and `downloadData`                           |
| `list`   | `list`, and `getProperties`                           |
| `write`  | `uploadData`, `copy`                                  |
| `delete` | `remove`                                              |

<Callout>

**Note:** `read` is a combination of `get` and `list` access definitions and hence cannot be defined in the presence of `get` or `list`.

</Callout>

## For Gen 1 public, protected, and private access pattern

To configure `defineStorage` in Amplify Gen 2 to behave the same way as the storage category in Gen 1, the following definition can be used.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myProjectFiles',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'public/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read'])
      allow.authenticated.to(['read', 'write', 'delete']),
    ],
    'protected/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read']),
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'private/{entity_id}/*': [allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])]
  })
});
```
