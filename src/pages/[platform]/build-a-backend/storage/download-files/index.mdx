You can easily display images on your app by using the cloud-connected Storage Image UI component. This component fetches images securely from your storage resource and displays it on the web page.

```bash
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react-storage aws-amplify
```
```tsx
import { StorageImage } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-storage';

export const DefaultStorageImageExample = () => {
  return <StorageImage alt="cat" imgKey="cat.jpg" accessLevel="guest" />;
};
```

Learn more about how you can further customize the UI component by referring to the [Storage Image documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/storage/storagemanager).

#### API Usage
To further customize your in-app experience, you can use the `getUrl` or `downloadData` API from the Amplify Library for Storage.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Users can run into unexpected issues, so we are giving you advance notice in documentation with links to open issues - please vote for what you need, to help the team prioritize.

- `downloadData` is cached; if you have recently modified a file you may not get the latest version right away. You can pass in `cacheControl: 'no-cache'` to get the latest version.
- `downloadData` only returns the latest cached version of the file; there is [not yet an API to view prior versions](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2131).
- [Image compression](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/6081) or CloudFront CDN caching for your S3 buckets is not yet possible.
- There is no API for [Cognito Group-based access to files](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/3388).
- There is currently [no API for getting the `identityId` of other users](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/5177); you have to retrieve this from elsewhere before calling `Storage.get`.
