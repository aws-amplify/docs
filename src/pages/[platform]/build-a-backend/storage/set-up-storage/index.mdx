In this guide, you will learn how to set up storage in your Amplify app. You will set up your backend resources, and enable listing, uploading, and downloading files.

If you have not yet created an Amplify app, visit the [quickstart guide](/[platform]/start/quickstart/).

Amplify Storage seamlessly integrates file storage and management capabilities into frontend web and mobile apps, built on top of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). It provides intuitive APIs and UI components for core file operations, enabling developers to build scalable and secure file storage solutions without dealing with cloud service complexities.

## Building your storage backend

First, create a file `amplify/storage/resource.ts`. This file will be the location where you configure your storage backend. Instantiate storage using the `defineStorage` function and providing a `name` for your storage bucket. This `name` is a friendly name to identify your bucket in your backend configuration. Amplify will generate a unique identifier for your app using a UUID, the name attribute is just for use in your app.

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'amplifyTeamDrive'
});
```

Import your storage definition in your `amplify/backend.ts` file that contains your backend definition. Add storage to `defineBackend`.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
// highlight-next-line
import { storage } from './storage/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  // highlight-next-line
  storage
});
```

Now when you run `npx ampx sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will configure an Amazon S3 bucket where your files will be stored. Before files can be accessed in your application, you must configure storage access rules.

To deploy these changes, commit them to git and push the changes upstream. Amplify's CI/CD system will automatically pick up the changes and build and deploy the updates.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "add storage backend"
git push
```

### Define File Path Access

By default, no users or other project resources have access to any files in the storage bucket. Access must be explicitly granted within `defineStorage` using the `access` callback.

The access callback returns an object where each key in the object is a file path and each value in the object is an array of access rules that apply to that path.

The following example shows you how you can set up your file storage structure for a generic photo sharing app. Here,

1. Guests have access to see all profile pictures and only the users that uploaded the profile picture can replace or delete them. Users are identified by their Identity Pool ID in this case i.e. identityID.
2. There's also a general pool where all users can submit pictures.

[Learn more about customizing access to file path](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/authorization/).

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'amplifyTeamDrive',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'profile-pictures/{entity_id}/*': [
      allow.guest.to(['read'])
      allow.entity('identity').to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ],
    'picture-submissions/*': [
      allow.authenticated.to(['read','write']),
      allow.guest.to(['read', 'write'])
    ],
  })
});
```

## Connect your app code to the storage backend

The Amplify Storage library provides client APIs that connect to the backend resources you defined.

<InlineFilter filters={["react", "angular", "javascript", "vue", "nextjs", "react-native"]}>

### Configure Amplify in project

{/* this document has configuration but we're not actually using any of the libraries or UI components in this guide - should this instead just link you to the connect to backend guide? the intro says we "enable listing, uploading, and downloading files." but we aren't doing that - should we add that? */}

{/* We're inconsistent on pre-requisites across categories - JS doesn't have them but others do, is this intentional?  */}
Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `index.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import outputs from '../amplify_outputs.json';

Amplify.configure(outputs);
```
<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your application’s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs.

### Configure Amplify in your project

Initialize Amplify Storage by calling `Amplify.addPlugin()`. To complete initialization, call `Amplify.configure()`.

Add the following code to your `onCreate()` method in your application class:

<Callout warning>
Before calling the `Amplify.configure` function, make sure to either download the `amplify_outputs.json` file from the console, or generate it with the following command: 

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <app-id> --branch main --out-dir app/src/main/res/raw
```

Next, be sure the file you generated or downloaded is in the appropriate resource directory for your application (for example, `app/src/main/res/raw`) in your Android project. Otherwise, you will not be able to compile your application.

## Manage files in Amplify console

After successfully publishing your storage backend and connecting your project with client APIs, you can manage files and folders in [the Amplify console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify). You can perform on-demand actions like upload, download, copy, and more under the Storage tab in the console.
