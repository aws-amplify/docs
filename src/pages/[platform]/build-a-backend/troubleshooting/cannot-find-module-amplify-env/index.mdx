When deploying a Amplify Gen 2 app, you may encounter the error message `Cannot find module $amplify/env/<function-name>` in your frontend build on Amplify Console. This error occurs when your framework `tsconfig.json` configuration picks up the `amplify` directory and tries to resolve it as a module. This module is a placeholder for environment variables that are injected at build time by Amplify. To resolve this error, you need to exclude the `amplify` directory.

To exclude the `amplify` directory in your `tsconfig.json`, add the following lines to the `exclude` section:

```ts title='tsconfig.json'

{
  "exclude": ["amplify/**/*"]
}
```

Amplify will perform type-checking on sandbox and pipeline-deploy using the tsconfig local to the Amplify backend `amplify/tsconfig.json`. If you'd like to extend your base configuration you can add it to the localized tsconfig.

Alternatively, if you work within a monorepo you can move your backend to its own package and export the Schema and outputs for ease of sharing with your other apps. For example, in your backend package's `package.json`

```json title='package.json'
{
  "name": "my-backend",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    "./schema": "./amplify/data/resource.ts",
    "./outputs": "./amplify_outputs.json"
  }
}
```
