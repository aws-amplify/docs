The following content requires you to deploy the Amplify GraphQL APIs via AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). If you have not yet deployed an Amplify GraphQL API with AWS CDK yet, review [Set up GraphQL API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api).

</Callout>


In this section, you'll learn how to:

- Connect Amplify GraphQL API to an existing MySQL or PostgreSQL database
- Execute SQL statements with custom GraphQL queries and mutations using the new `@sql` directive
- Generate create, read, update, and delete API operations based on your SQL database schema

## Connect your API with an existing MySQL or PostgreSQL database

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

Pre-requisites:

- Have an existing [MySQL database](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-mysql-db/) or [PostgreSQL database](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/create-connect-postgresql-db/) deployed
- The [AWS CDK CLI is installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_install)
- Have an [AWS CDK application initialized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/hello_world.html)

<Callout warning>

First, place your database connection information (hostname, username, password, port, and database name) into Systems Manager, each as a `SecureString`.

Go to the Systems Manager console, navigate to Parameter Store, and click "Create Parameter". Create five different SecureStrings: one each for the hostname of your database server, the username and password to connect, the database port, and the database name.

Your Systems Manager configuration should look something like this:

![Storing Database Credentials in SSM](/images/storing-db-creds-in-ssm.png)

Install the following package to add the Amplify GraphQL API construct to your dependencies:

```sh
npm install @aws-amplify/graphql-api-construct
```

Create a new `schema.sql.graphql` file within your CDK app’s `lib/` folder that includes the APIs you want to expose. Define your GraphQL object types, queries, and mutations to match the APIs you wish to expose. For example, define object types for database tables, queries to fetch data from those tables, and mutations to modify those tables.

```graphql
type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  content: String!
  published: Boolean
  publishedDate: AWSDate @refersTo(name: "published_date")
}

type Query {
  searchPosts(contains: String!): [Post]
    @sql(
      statement: "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE CONCAT('%', :contains, '%');"
    )
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}

type Mutation {
  createPost(title: String! content: String!): AWSJSON
    @sql(statement: "INSERT INTO posts (title, content) VALUES (:title, :content);")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

You can use the `:variable` notation to reference input variables from the query request.

<Accordion title="Authorization rules" headingLevel="3" eyebrow="Learn more" >
Amplify’s GraphQL API operates on a deny-by-default basis. The `{ allow: public }` auth rule in the example schema above designates that anyone using an API Key is authorized to execute the query.

Review [Authorization rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/) to limit access to these queries and mutations based on API Key, Amazon Cognito User Pool, OpenID Connect, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), or a custom Lambda function.

</Accordion>

Next, open the main stack file in your CDK project (usually located in `lib/<your-project-name>-stack.ts`). Import the necessary constructs at the top of the file:

```ts
import {
  AmplifyGraphqlApi,
  AmplifyGraphqlDefinition
} from '@aws-amplify/graphql-api-construct';
 
import path from 'path';
```

In the main stack class, add the following code to define a new GraphQL API. Replace `stack` with the name of your stack instance (often referenced via `this`):

```ts
new AmplifyGraphqlApi(stack, 'SqlBoundApi', {
  apiName: 'MySqlBoundApi',
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFilesAndStrategy(
    [path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql.graphql')],
    {
      name: 'MySQLSchemaDefinition',
      dbType: 'MYSQL',
      vpcConfiguration: {
        vpcId: 'vpc-123456',
        securityGroupIds: ['sg-123', 'sg-456'],
        subnetAvailabilityZoneConfig: [
          { subnetId: 'sn-123456', availabilityZone: 'us-east-1a' },
          { subnetId: 'sn-987654', availabilityZone: 'us-east-1b' }
        ]
      },
      dbConnectionConfig: {
        hostnameSsmPath:
          '/path/to/ssm/SecureString/containing/value/of/hostname',
        portSsmPath: '/path/to/ssm/SecureString/containing/value/of/port',
        usernameSsmPath:
          '/path/to/ssm/SecureString/containing/value/of/username',
        passwordSsmPath:
          '/path/to/ssm/SecureString/containing/value/of/password',
        databaseNameSsmPath:
          '/path/to/ssm/SecureString/containing/value/of/databaseName'
      }
    }
  ),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    }
  }
});
```

The API will have an API key enabled for authorization.

Before deploying, make sure to:

- Set a value for `name`. This will be used to name the AppSync DataSource itself, plus any associated resources like resolver Lambdas. This name must be unique across all schema definitions in a GraphQL API.

- Change the `dbType` to match your database engine. This is the type of the SQL database used to process model operations for this definition.Supported engines are `"MYSQL"` or `"POSTGRES"`.

- Update the SSM parameter paths within `dbConnectionConfig` to point to those existing in your AWS account. These are the parameters the SQL Lambda will use to connect to the database.

- If your database instance exists within a VPC, update the `vpcConfiguration` properties - `vpcId`, `securityGroupIds`, and `subnetAvailabilityZoneConfig` with your vpc details. This is the configuration of the VPC into which to install the SQL Lambda.

<Accordion title="Configure VPC settings for your database" headingLevel="3" eyebrow="Learn more">

If your database exists within a VPC, the RDS instance must be configured to be `Publicly accessible`. This does not mean the instance needs to accessible from the internet.

The target security group(s) must have two inbound rules set up:

- A rule allowing traffic on port 443 from the security group.

- An inbound rule allowing traffic on the database port from the security group. (Default: 3306 for MySQL. 5432 for PostgreSQL.)

In addition, the target security group(s) must have two outbound rules set up:

- An outbound rule allowing traffic on port 443 to the security group.

- An outbound rule allowing traffic on the database port to the security group. (Default: 3306 for MySQL. 5432 for PostgreSQL.)

<Accordion title="RDS Proxy for improved connectivity" headingLevel="3" eyebrow="Learn more">

Consider adding an RDS Proxy in front of the cluster to manage database connections.

When using Amplify GraphQL API with a relational database like Amazon RDS, each query from your application needs to open a separate connection to the database.

If there are a large number of queries occurring concurrently, it can exceed the connection limit on the database and result in errors like "Too many connections". To avoid this, Amplify can use an RDS Proxy when connecting your GraphQL API to a database.

The RDS Proxy acts as an intermediary sitting in front of your database. Instead of each application query opening a direct connection to the database, they will connect through the Proxy. The Proxy helps manage and pool these connections to avoid overwhelming your database cluster. This improves the availability of your API, allowing more queries to execute concurrently without hitting connection limits.

However, there is a tradeoff of increased latency - queries may take slightly longer as they wait for an available connection from the Proxy pool. There are also additional costs associated with using RDS Proxy. Please refer to the [pricing page for RDS Proxy](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/pricing/) to learn more.

</Accordion>

## Create custom queries and mutations

Amplify GraphQL API for SQL databases introduces the `@sql` directive, which allows you to define SQL statements in custom GraphQL queries and mutations. This provides more flexibility when the default, auto-generated GraphQL queries and mutations are not sufficient.

There are two ways to specify the SQL statement - inline or by referencing a `.sql` file.

### Inline SQL Statement

For getting started, you can embed the SQL statement directly in the schema using the `statement` argument.

The SQL statement can use parameters in the format `:variable`, which will be bound to the input variables passed when executing a custom GraphQL query or mutation.

In the example below, a SQL statement is defined, accepting a `searchTerm` input variable.

```graphql
type Query {
  searchPosts(searchTerm: String): [Post]
    @sql(statement: "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE :searchTerm;")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

{/* TODO: Add a NOTE: about proxy/connection pinning here. */}

### SQL File Reference

For longer, more complex SQL queries, you can specify the statement in separate `.sql` files rather than inline. Referencing a file keeps your schema clean and allows reuse of SQL statements across fields.

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="AWS CDK">

First, update your GraphQL schema file to reference a SQL file name without the `.sql` extension:

```graphql
type Query {
  getPublishedPosts(start: AWSDate, end: AWSDate): [Post]
    @sql(reference: "getPublishedPostsByDateRange")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

Next, create a new `lib/sql-statements` folder and add any custom queries or mutations as SQL files. For example, you could create different `.sql` files for different queries:

```sql
-- lib/sql-statements/getPublishedPostsByDateRange.sql
SELECT p.id, p.title, p.content, p.published_date
FROM posts p
WHERE p.published = 1
  AND p.published_date > :startDate
  AND p.published_date < :endDate
ORDER BY p.published_date DESC
LIMIT 10
```

```sql
-- lib/sql-statements/getPostById.sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = :id;
```

Then, you can import the `SQLLambdaModelDataSourceStrategyFactory` which helps define the datasource strategy from the custom `.sql` files you've created.

```js
import { SQLLambdaModelDataSourceStrategyFactory } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-api-construct';
import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';
```

In your `lib/<your-project-name>-stack.ts` file, read from the `sql-statements/` folder and add them as custom SQL statements to your Amplify GraphQL API:

```js

// Define custom SQL statements folder path
const sqlStatementsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'sql-statements');

// Use the Factory to define the SQL data source strategy
const sqlStrategy = SQLLambdaModelDataSourceStrategyFactory.fromCustomSqlFiles(
  // File paths to all SQL statements
  fs
    .readdirSync(sqlStatementsPath)
    .map((file) => path.join(sqlStatementsPath, file)),
  // Move your connection information and VPC config into here
  {
    dbType: 'MYSQL',
    name: 'MySQLSchemaDefinition',
    dbConnectionConfig: {
      //...
    },
    vpcConfiguration: {
      //...
    }
  }
);


const amplifyApi = new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, 'SqlBoundApi', {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFilesAndStrategy(
    [path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql.graphql')],
    sqlStrategy
  ),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    }
  }
});
```

The SQL statements defined in the `.sql` files will be executed as if they were defined inline in the schema. The same rules apply in terms of using parameters, ensuring valid SQL syntax, and matching the return type to row data.

<Callout warning>

This feature is currently not supported on Amplify CLI. It requires you to deploy the Amplify GraphQL APIs via AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). If you have not yet deployed an Amplify GraphQL API with AWS CDK yet, review [Set up GraphQL API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api).

</Callout>

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

### Custom Query

For reference, you define a GraphQL query by adding a new field under a `type Query` object:

```graphql
type Query {
  searchPostsByTitle(title: String): [Post]
    @sql(
      statement: "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE CONCAT('%', :title, '%');"
    )
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

### Custom Mutation

For reference, you define a GraphQL mutation by adding a new field under a `type Mutation` object:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  publishPostById(id: ID!): AWSJSON
    @sql(statement: "UPDATE posts SET published = :published WHERE id = :id;")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

### Returning row data from custom mutations

SQL statements such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` return the number of rows affected.

If you want to return the result of the SQL statement, you can use `AWSJSON` as the return type.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  publishPosts: AWSJSON @sql(statement: "UPDATE posts SET published = 1;")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

This will return a JSON response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "publishPosts": "{\"fieldCount\":0,\"affectedRows\":7,\"insertId\":0,\"info\":\"Rows matched: 7  Changed: 7  Warnings: 0\",\"serverStatus\":34,\"warningStatus\":0,\"changedRows\":7}"
  }
}
```

However, you might want to return the actual row data instead.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="MySQL">

In MySQL, you can create and call a stored procedure that performs both an UPDATE statement and SELECT query to return a single post.

Create a stored procedure by running the following SQL statement in your MySQL database:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE publish_post (IN postId VARCHAR(255))

BEGIN
UPDATE posts SET published = 1 WHERE id = postId;

SELECT * FROM posts WHERE id = postId LIMIT 1;
END
```

Call the stored procedure from the custom mutation:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  publishPostById(id: String!): [Post]
    @sql(statement: "CALL publish_post(:id);")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="PostgreSQL">

In PostgreSQL, you can add a `RETURNING` clause to an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement and get the actual modified row data.

Example:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  publishPostById(id: String!): [Post]
    @sql(statement: "UPDATE posts SET price = :id RETURNING *;")
    @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }])
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

<Callout info>
  The return type for custom queries and mutations expecting row data must
  be an array of the corresponding model.
</Callout>


## Apply authorization rules

The `@auth` directive can be used to restrict access to data and operations by specifying authorization rules. It allows granular access control over the GraphQL API based on the user's identity and attributes. You can for example, limit a query or mutation to only logged-in users via an `@auth(rules: [{ allow: private }])` rule or limit access to only users of the "Admin" group via an `@auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }])` rule.

All model-level authorization rules are supported for Amplify GraphQL schemas generated from MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

<Callout warning>**Limitation:** Field level auth rules are not supported.</Callout>

In the example below, public users authorized via API Key are granted unrestricted access to all posts.

Add the following auth rule to the `Post` model within the `schema.sql.graphql` file:

```graphql
type Post @model @refersTo(name: "posts") @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  title: String!
  content: String!
}
```

For more information on each rule please refer to our documentation on [Authorization rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/).

## Deploy your API

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="AWS CDK">
To deploy the API, you can use the `cdk deploy` command:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

</Block>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

Now the API has been deployed and you can start using it!

You can start querying from the AWS AppSync console or integrate it into your application using the AWS Amplify libraries!

## Auto-generate CRUDL operations for existing tables

You can generate common CRUDL operations for your database tables based on your database schema. This saves time from hand-authoring the GraphQL types, queries, and mutations and SQL statements for common CRUDL use cases. After you generate the operations, you can annotate the `@model` types with authorization rules.

Create a `Ingredients` table in your database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Ingredients (
  id      varchar(255)  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name    varchar(255)  NOT NULL,
  unit_of_measurement varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  price   decimal(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  supplier_id int,
);
```

### Step 1 - Export database schema as CSV

Execute the following SQL statement on your database using a MySQL, PostgreSQL Client, or CLI tool similar to `psql` and export the output to a CSV file:

<Callout warning>
  You must include column headers when exporting the database schema output to a CSV file.
</Callout>

Replace `<database-name>` with the name of your database/schema.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="MySQL">

SELECT DISTINCT
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS.TABLE_NAME,
  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS.COLUMN_NAME,

WHERE INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS.TABLE_SCHEMA = '<database-name>';
--                    Replace database name here ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Step 2 - Generate GraphQL schema from database schema

Next, generate an Amplify GraphQL API schema by running the following command, replacing the `--engine-type` value with your database engine of `mysql` or `postgres`, and the `--sql-schema` value with the path to the CSV file created in the previous step:

```bash
npx @aws-amplify/cli api generate-schema --engine-type mysql --sql-schema schema.csv --out schema.sql.graphql
```


Next, update the first argument of `AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFilesAndStrategy` to include the `schema.sql.graphql` file generated in the previous step:

```ts
new AmplifyGraphqlApi(stack, 'SqlBoundApi', {
  apiName: 'MySqlBoundApi',
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFilesAndStrategy(
    [path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql.graphql')], // file path
    {
      // ...strategy options
    }
  )
});
```

### Step 3 - Apply authorization rules for your generated GraphQL API

Open your **schema.sql.graphql** file, you should see something like this. The auto-generated schema automatically changes the casing to better match common GraphQL conventions. Amplify's GraphQL API's operate on a **deny-by-default principle**, this means you must explicitly add `@auth` authorization rules in order to make this API accessible to your users. Currently only model-level authorization is supported.

```graphql
input AMPLIFY {
 engine: String = "mysql"
}


type Ingredient @refersTo(name: "Ingredients") @model {
  id: Int! @refersTo(name: "ingredient_id") @primaryKey
  name: String!
  unitOfMeasurement: String! @refersTo(name: "unit_of_measurement")
  price: Float!
  supplierId: Int @refersTo(name: "supplier_id")
}
```

In our example, we'll add a public authorization rule, meaning anyone with an API key can create, read, update, and delete records from the database. Review [Customize authorization rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/) to see the full scope of model-level authorization capabilities.

```diff
input AMPLIFY {
 engine: String = "mysql"
}


- type Ingredient @refersTo(name: "Ingredients") @model {
+ type Ingredient
+   @refersTo(name: "Ingredients")
+   @model 
+   @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: Int! @refersTo(name: "ingredient_id") @primaryKey
  name: String!
  unitOfMeasurement: String! @refersTo(name: "unit_of_measurement")
  price: Float!
  supplierId: Int @refersTo(name: "supplier_id")
}
```

Finally, remember to deploy your API to the cloud:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="AWS CDK">
To deploy the API, you can use the `cdk deploy` command:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

</Block>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

<Callout warning>

This feature is currently not supported on Amplify CLI. It requires you to deploy the Amplify GraphQL APIs via AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

</Callout>

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Now the API has been deployed and you can start using it!

### Rename & map models to tables

To rename models and fields, you can use the `@refersTo` directive to map the models in the GraphQL schema to the corresponding table or field by name.

By default, the Amplify CLI singularizes each model name using PascalCase and field names that are either snake_case or kebab-case will be converted to camelCase.

In the example below, the Post model in the GraphQL schema is now mapped to the posts table in the database schema. Also, the `isPublished` is now mapped to the `published` column on the posts table.

```graphql
type Post @refersTo(name: "posts") @model {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  title: String!
  content: String!
  isPublished: Boolean @refersTo(name: "published")
  publishedDate: AWSDate @refersTo(name: "published_date")
}
```

### Create relationships between models

You can use the `@hasOne`, `@hasMany`, and `@belongsTo` relational directives to create relationships between models. The field named in the `references` parameter of the relational directives must exist on the child model.

<Callout warning>

Relationships that query across DynamoDB and SQL data sources are currently not supported. However, you can create relationships across SQL data sources.

</Callout>

Assume that you have `users`, `blogs`, and `posts` tables in your database schema. The following examples demonstrate how you might create different types of relationships between them. Use them as references for creating relationships between the models in your own schema.

#### Has One relationship

Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models using the `@hasOne` directive.

In the example below, a User has a single Blog.

```graphql
type User
  @refersTo(name: "users")
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }, { allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }]) {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  name: String!
  owner: String
  blog: Blog @hasOne(references: ["userId"])
}
```

#### Has Many relationship

Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models using the `@hasMany` directive.

In the example below, a Blog has many Posts.

```graphql
type Blog @model {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  title: String!
  posts: [Post] @hasMany(references: ["blogId"])
}

type Post @model {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  title: String!
  content: String!
  blogId: String! @refersTo(name: "blog_id")
}
```

#### Belongs To relationship

Make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional with the `@belongsTo` directive.

In the example below, a Post belongs to a Blog.

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: String! @primaryKey
  title: String!
  content: String!
  blogId: String! @refersTo(name: "blog_id")
  blog: Blog @belongsTo(references: ["blogId"])
}
```

### Apply iterative changes from the database definition

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="AWS CDK">
  1. Make any adjustments to your SQL statements such as:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id              varchar(255)           NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title           varchar(255)           NOT NULL,
  content         varchar(255)           NOT NULL,
  published       tinyint(1)  DEFAULT 0  NOT NULL
  published_date  date                       NULL
);
```

2. Regenerate the database schema as a CSV file by following the instructions in [Generate GraphQL schema from database schema](#step-2---generate-graphql-schema-from-database-schema).

3. Generate an updated schema by running the following command, replacing the `--engine-type` value with your database engine of `mysql` or `postgres`, and the `--sql-schema` value with the path to the CSV file created in the previous step:

```sh
npx @aws-amplify/cli api generate-schema --engine-type mysql --sql-schema schema.csv --out schema.sql.graphql
```

4. Deploy your changes to the cloud:

```sh
cdk deploy
```

<Block name="Amplify CLI">

<Callout warning>

This feature is currently not supported on Amplify CLI. It requires you to deploy the Amplify GraphQL APIs via AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). If you have not yet deployed an Amplify GraphQL API with AWS CDK yet, review [Set up GraphQL API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api).

</Callout>

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## How does it work?

The Amplify uses AWS Lambda functions to enable features like querying data from your database. To work properly, these Lambda functions need access to common logic and dependencies.

Amplify provides this shared code in the form of Lambda Layers. You can think of Lambda Layers as a package of reusable runtime code that Lambda functions can reference.

When you deploy an Amplify API, it will create two Lambda functions:

### SQL Lambda

This allows you to query and write data to your database from your API.

<Callout>
  **NOTE:** If the database is in a VPC, this Lambda function will be deployed
  in the same VPC as the database. The usage of Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
  (VPC) or VPC peering, with AWS Lambda functions will incur additional charges
  as explained, this comes with an additional cost as explained on the [Amazon
  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) on-demand pricing
  page](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/).
</Callout>

### Updater Lambda

This automatically keeps the SQL Lambda up-to-date by managing its Lambda Layers.

A Lambda layer that includes all the core SQL connection logic lives within the AWS Amplify service account but is executed within your AWS account, when invoked by the SQL Lambda. This allows the Amplify service team to own the ongoing maintenance and security enhancements of the SQL connection logic.

This allows the Amplify team to maintain and enhance the SQL Layer without needing direct access to your Lambdas. If updates to the Layer are needed, the Updater Lambda will receive a signal from Amplify and automatically update the SQL Lambda with the latest Layer.

### Mapping of SQL data types to GraphQL types when auto-generating GraphQL schema

<Callout warning>

**Note:** MySQL does not support time zone offsets in date time or timestamp fields. Instead, we will convert these values to `datetime`, without the offset.

Unlike MySQL, PostgreSQL does support date time or timestamp values with an offset.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To return the actual SQL error instead of a generic error from GraphQL responses, an environment variable `DEBUG_MODE` can be set to `true` on the Amplify-generated SQL Lambda function. You can find this Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console with the naming convention of: `<stack-name>-<api-name>-SQLLambdaFunction<hash>`.

## Next steps

Our recommended next steps include using the GraphQL API to mutate and query data on app clients or how to customize the authorization rules for your custom queries and mutations. Some resources that will help with this work include:

- [Create, update, and delete application data](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/mutate-data/)
- [Read application data](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/query-data/)
- [Customize Authorization Rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/)
