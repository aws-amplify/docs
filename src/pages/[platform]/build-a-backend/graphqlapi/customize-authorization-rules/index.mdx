Use the `@auth` directive to configure authorization rules for public, sign-in user, per user, and per user group data access. **Authorization rules operate on the deny-by-default principle**. Meaning that if an authorization rule is not specifically configured, it is denied.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, each signed-in user, or also known as "owner", of a Todo can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

Amplify also allows you to restrict the allowed operations, combine multiple authorization rules, and apply fine-grained field-level authorization.

```graphql
type Todo
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: public, operations: [read] }, { allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, everyone (`public`) can read every Todo but owner (authenticated users) can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

### Global authorization rule (only for getting started)

To help you get started, there's a global authorization rule defined when you create a new GraphQL schema. For production environments, remove the global authorization rule and apply rules on each model instead.

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Amplify CLI">

```graphql
input AMPLIFY {
  globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

In the CDK construct, we call this the "sandbox mode" that you need to explicitly enable via an input parameter.

```ts
new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, "MyNewApi", {
  ...,
  translationBehavior: {
    sandboxModeEnabled: true
  }
});
```

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

The global authorization rule (in this case `{ allow: public }` - allows anyone to create, read, update, and delete) is applied to every data model in the GraphQL schema.

**Note:** Amplify will always use the most specific authorization rule that's present. For example, a field-level authorization rule will be used in favor of a model-level authorization rule; similarly, a model-level authorization rule will be used in favor of a global authorization rule.

<Callout warning>

Currently, only `{ allow: public }` is supported as a global authorization rule.

</Callout>

## Authorization strategies

Use the guide below to select the correct authorization strategy for your use case:

| **Recommended use case** | **Strategy** | **Provider** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public data access where users or devices are anonymous. Anyone with the AppSync API key is granted access. | [`public`](#public-data-access) | `apiKey` |
| Recommended for production environment's public data access. Public data access where unauthenticated users or devices are granted permissions using AWS IAM controls. | [`public`](#public-data-access) | `iam` |
| Per user data access. Access is restricted to the "owner" of a record. Leverages `amplify add auth` Cognito user pool by default. | [`owner`](#per-user--owner-based-data-access) | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Any signed-in data access. Unlike owner-based access, **any** signed-in user has access. | [`private`](#signed-in-user-data-access) | `userPools` / `oidc` / `iam` |
| Per user group data access. A specific or dynamically configured group of users have access | [`groups`](#user-group-based-data-access) | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Define your own custom authorization rule within a Lambda function | [`custom`](#custom-authorization-rule) | `function` |

### Public data access

To grant everyone access, use the `public` authorization strategy. Behind the scenes, the API will be protected with an API Key.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  content: String
}
```

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Unauthenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API Key.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

When you run `amplify add auth`, the Amplify CLI generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Unauthenticated role" in Cognito identity pool automatically.

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

Designate an IAM role for unauthenticated identities by setting the `iamConfig` property:

```ts
// Note: this sample uses the alpha Cognito Identity Pool construct, but is not required, CfnIdentityPool can be used as well
import cognito_identitypool from '@aws-cdk/aws-cognito-identitypool-alpha';

const identityPool = new cognito_identitypool.IdentityPool(stack, 'MyNewIdentityPool', {
  allowUnauthenticatedIdentities: true,
  authenticationProviders: { userPools: [new cognito_identitypool.UserPoolAuthenticationProvider({
    userPool: <your_user_pool>,
    userPoolClient: <your_user_pool_client>,
  })] },
});

new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, "MyNewApi", {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFiles(path.join(__dirname, "schema.graphql")),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    },
    iamConfig: {
      identityPoolId: identityPool.identityPoolId,
      authenticatedUserRole: identityPool.authenticatedRole,
      unauthenticatedUserRole: identityPool.unauthenticatedRole,
    }
  },
})
```

<InlineFilter filters={["react", "angular", "nextjs", "vue", "react-native", "javascript"]}>

In the Amplify Library's client configuration file (`amplifyconfiguration.json`) set `allowGuestAccess` to `true`. This lets the Amplify Library use the unauthenticated role from your Cognito identity pool when your user isn't logged in. 

```json
{
	"Auth": {
		"Cognito": {
			"userPoolId": "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID",
			"userPoolClientId": "YOUR_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID",
			"identityPoolId": "YOUR_IDENTITY_POOL_ID",
			"allowGuestAccess": true
		},
	},
	"API": {
		"GraphQL": {
			"endpoint": "YOUR_API_ENDPOINT",
			"region": "YOUR_API_REGION",
			"defaultAuthMode": "YOUR_DEFAULT_AUTHORIZATION_MODE",
		},
	},
}
```

</InlineFilter>

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

```graphql
# public authorization with provider override
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public, provider: iam }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

### Per-user / owner-based data access

To restrict a record's access to a specific user, use the `owner` authorization strategy. When `owner` authorization is configured, only the record's `owner` is allowed the specified operations.

```graphql
# The "owner" of a Todo is allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own todos
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}

# The "owner" of a Todo record is only allowed to create, read, and update it.
# The "owner" of a Todo record is denied to delete it.
type Todo
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, operations: [create, read, update] }]) {
  content: String
}
```

Behind the scenes, Amplify will automatically add a `owner: String` field to each record which contains the record owner's identity information upon record creation.

By default, the Cognito user pool's user information is populated into the `owner` field. The value saved includes `sub` and `username` in the format `<sub>::<username>`. The API will authorize against the full value of `<sub>::<username>` or `sub` / `username` separately and return `username`. You can alternatively configure [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

You can override the `owner` field to your own preferred field, by specifying a custom `ownerField` in the authorization rule.

<Callout>

Do not set `ownerField` to your `@primaryKey` field or `id` field if no primary key is specified. If you want to query by the `ownerField`, use an `@index` on that `ownerField` to create a secondary index.

</Callout>

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, ownerField: "author" }]) {
  content: String #^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  author: String # record owner information now stored in "author" field
}
```

<Callout warning>

**By default, owners can reassign the owner of their existing record to another user.**

To prevent an owner from reassigning their record to another user, protect the owner field (by default `owner: String`) with a [field-level authorization rule](#field-level-authorization-rules). For example, in a social media app, you would want to prevent Alice from being able to reassign Alice's Post to Bob.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  id: ID!
  description: String
  owner: String @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, operations: [read, delete] }])
}
```

</Callout>

### Multi-user data access

If you want to grant a set of users access to a record, you can override the `ownerField` to a list of owners. Use this if you want a dynamic set of users to have access to a record.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, ownerField: "authors" }]) {
  content: String
  authors: [String]
}
```

In the example above, upon record creation, the `authors` list is populated with the creator of the record. The creator can then update the `authors` field with additional users. Any user listed in the `authors` field can access the record.

### Signed-in user data access

To restrict a record's access to every signed-in user, use the `private` authorization strategy.

> If you want to restrict a record's access to a specific user, see [Per-user / owner-based data access](#per-user--owner-based-data-access). `private` authorization applies the authorization rule to **every** signed-in user access.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: private }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, anyone with a valid JWT token from Cognito user pool are allowed to access all Todos.

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Authenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API Key.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

When you run `amplify add auth`, the Amplify CLI generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Authenticated role" in Cognito identity pool automatically.

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

Designate an IAM role for authenticated identities by setting the `iamConfig` property:

```ts
// Note: this sample uses the alpha Cognito Identity Pool construct, but is not required, CfnIdentityPool can be used as well
import cognito_identitypool from '@aws-cdk/aws-cognito-identitypool-alpha';

const identityPool = new cognito_identitypool.IdentityPool(stack, 'MyNewIdentityPool', {
  allowUnauthenticatedIdentities: true,
  authenticationProviders: { userPools: [new cognito_identitypool.UserPoolAuthenticationProvider({
    userPool: <your_user_pool>,
    userPoolClient: <your_user_pool_client>,
  })] },
});

new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, "MyNewApi", {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFiles(path.join(__dirname, "schema.graphql")),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    },
    iamConfig: {
      identityPoolId: identityPool.identityPoolId,
      authenticatedUserRole: identityPool.authenticatedRole,
      unauthenticatedUserRole: identityPool.unauthenticatedRole,
    }
  },
})
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: private, provider: iam }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In addition, you can also use OpenID Connect with `private` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

**Note:** If you have a connected child model that allows `private` level access, any user authorized to fetch it from the parent model will be able to read the connected child model. For example,

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  task: [Task] @hasMany
}

type Task
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }, { allow: private, operations: [read] }]) {
  id: ID!
  description: String!
}
```

In the above relationship, the owner of a `Todo` record can query all the tasks connected to it, since the `Task` model allows `private` read access.

### User group-based data access

To restrict access based on user groups, use the `group` authorization strategy.

**Static group authorization**: When you want to restrict access to a specific set of user groups, provide the group names in the `groups` parameter.

```graphql
type Salary @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }]) {
  id: ID!
  wage: Int
  currency: String
}
```

In the example above, only users that are part of the "Admin" user group are granted access to the Salary model.

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "react-native", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>
**Dynamic group authorization**: When you want to restrict access to a set of user groups.

```graphql
# Dynamic group authorization with multiple groups
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groupsField: "groups" }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  groups: [String]
}

# Dynamic group authorization with a single group
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groupsField: "group" }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  group: String
}
```

With dynamic group authorization, each record contains an attribute specifying what Cognito groups should be able to access it. Use the `groupsField` argument to specify which attribute in the underlying data store holds this group information. To specify that a single group should have access, use a field of type `String`. To specify that multiple groups should have access, use a field of type `[String]`.

By default, `group` authorization leverages Amazon Cognito user pool groups but you can also use OpenID Connect with `group` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

**Known limitations for real-time subscriptions when using dynamic group authorization**:

1. If you authorize based on a single group per record, then subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 5 or fewer user groups
2. If you authorize via an array of groups (`groups: [String]` example above),

- subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 20 or fewer groups
- you can only authorize 20 or fewer user groups per record
</InlineFilter>

### Custom authorization rule

You can define your own custom authorization rule with a Lambda function.

```graphql
type Salary @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: custom }]) {
  id: ID!
  wage: Int
  currency: String
}
```

The Lambda function of choice will receive an authorization token from the client and execute the desired authorization logic. The AppSync GraphQL API will receive a payload from Lambda after invocation to allow or deny the API call accordingly.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

Configure the GraphQL API with the Lambda authorization mode, run the following command in your Terminal:

```bash
amplify update api
```

```
? Select a setting to edit:
> Authorization modes

> Lambda

? Choose a Lambda source:
> Create a new Lambda function
```

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

To configure a Lambda function as the authorization mode, set the `lambdaConfig` in the CDK construct. Use the `ttl` to designate the toke expiry time.

```ts
const amplifyApi = new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, 'MyNewApi', {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFiles(
    path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql')
  ),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'AWS_LAMBDA',
    lambdaConfig: {
      function: new lambda.Function(this, 'MyAuthLambda', {
        code: lambda.Code.fromAsset(path.join(__dirname, 'handlers/auth')),
        handler: 'index.handler',
        runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_18_X
      }),
      ttl: cdk.Duration.seconds(10)
    }
  }
});
```

You can leverage this Lambda function code template as a starting point to author your authorization handler code:

```js
// This is sample code. Please update this to suite your schema

/**
 * @type {import('@types/aws-lambda').APIGatewayProxyHandler}
 */
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log(`EVENT: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`);
  const {
    authorizationToken,
    requestContext: { apiId, accountId }
  } = event;
  const response = {
    isAuthorized: authorizationToken === 'custom-authorized',
    resolverContext: {
      // eslint-disable-next-line spellcheck/spell-checker
      userid: 'user-id',
      info: 'contextual information A',
      more_info: 'contextual information B'
    },
    deniedFields: [
      `arn:aws:appsync:${process.env.AWS_REGION}:${accountId}:apis/${apiId}/types/Event/fields/comments`,
      `Mutation.createEvent`
    ],
    ttlOverride: 300
  };
  console.log(`response >`, JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
  return response;
};
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

You can use the default Amplify provided template as a starting point for your custom authorization rule. The authorization Lambda function receives:

```json
{
    "authorizationToken": "ExampleAuthToken123123123", # Authorization token specified by client
    "requestContext": {
        "apiId": "aaaaaa123123123example123", # AppSync API ID
        "accountId": "111122223333", # AWS Account ID
        "requestId": "f4081827-1111-4444-5555-5cf4695f339f",
        "queryString": "mutation CreateEvent {...}\n\nquery MyQuery {...}\n", # GraphQL query
        "operationName": "MyQuery", # GraphQL operation name
        "variables": {} # any additional variables supplied to the operation
    }
}
```

Your Lambda authorization function needs to return the following JSON:

```json
{
  // required
  "isAuthorized": true, // if "false" then an UnauthorizedException is raised, access is denied
  "resolverContext": { "banana": "very yellow" }, // JSON object visible as $ctx.identity.resolverContext in VTL resolver templates

  // optional
  "deniedFields": ["TypeName.FieldName"], // Forces the fields to "null" when returned to the client
  "ttlOverride": 10 // The number of seconds that the response should be cached for. Overrides default specified in "amplify update api"
}
```

Review the Amplify Library documentation to set the custom authorization token for [GraphQL API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules#aws-lambda) and [DataStore](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/authz-rules-setup/#configure-custom-authorization-logic-with-aws-lambda).

## Configure multiple authorization rules

When combining multiple authorization rules, they are "logically OR"-ed.

```graphql
type Post
  @model
  @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: public, operations: [read], provider: iam }
      { allow: owner }
    ]
  ) {
  title: String
  content: String
}
```

```js
import { createPost } from './graphql/mutations';
import { listPosts } from './graphql/queries';

// Creating a post is restricted to Cognito User Pools
const newPostResult = await client.graphql({
  query: queries.createPost,
  variables: { input: { title: 'Hello World' } },
  authMode: 'userPool'
});

// Listing posts is available to all users (verified by IAM)
const listPostsResult = await client.graphql({
  query: queries.listPosts,
  authMode: 'iam'
});
```

In the example above:

- any user (signed in or not, verified by IAM) is allowed to read all posts
- owners are allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own posts.

If you are using DataStore and have multiple authorization rules, you can let DataStore automatically determine the best authorization mode client-side. Review how to [Configure Multiple Authorization Types](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/authz-rules-setup/#configure-multiple-authorization-types) on DataStore for more details.

## Field-level authorization rules

When an authorization rule is added to a field, it'll strictly define the authorization rules applied on the field. Field-level authorization rules **do not** inherit model-level authorization rules. Meaning, only the specified field-level authorization rule is applied.

```graphql
type Employee
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: private, operations: [read] }, { allow: owner }]) {
  name: String
  email: String
  ssn: String @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }])
}
```

In the example above:

- Owners are allowed to create, read, update, and delete Employee records they own
- Any signed in user has read access
- Any signed in user can read data with the exception of the `ssn` field. This field only has owner auth applied, the field-level auth rule means that model-level auth rules are not applied

<Callout warning>

To prevent sensitive data from being sent over subscriptions, the GraphQL Transformer needs to alter the response of mutations for those fields by setting them to null. Therefore, to facilitate field-level authorization with subscriptions, you need to either apply field-level authorization rules to all **required** fields, make the other fields nullable, or disable subscriptions by setting it to public or off.

</Callout>

In the example above:

- **any signed in user** is allowed to read the list of employees' `name` and `email` fields
- **only the employee/owner themselves** have CRUD access to their `ssn` field

<Callout warning>

To prevent unintended loss of data, the user or role that attempts to `delete` a record should have delete permissions on every field of the `@model` annotated GraphQL type. For example, in the schema below:

```graphql
type Todo
  @model
  @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: private, provider: iam }
      { allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
    @auth(
      rules: [
        { allow: private, provider: iam }
        { allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }
      ]
    )
  description: String @auth(rules: [{ allow: private, provider: iam }])
}
```

Since the `description` field is not accessible by "Admin" Cognito group users, they cannot delete any `Todo` records.

</Callout>

## Advanced

### Review and print access control matrix

Verify your API's access control matrix, by running the following command:

```bash
amplify status api -acm Blog
```

```console
iam:public
  ┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬────────┬────────┐
  │ (index) │ create │ read │ update │ delete │
  ├─────────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┤
  │  title  │ false  │ true │ false  │ false  │
  │ content │ false  │ true │ false  │ false  │
  └─────────┴────────┴──────┴────────┴────────┘
userPools:owner:owner
  ┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬────────┬────────┐
  │ (index) │ create │ read │ update │ delete │
  ├─────────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┤
  │  title  │  true  │ true │  true  │  true  │
  │ content │  true  │ true │  true  │  true  │
  └─────────┴────────┴──────┴────────┴────────┘
```

### Use IAM authorization within the AppSync console

IAM-based `@auth` rules are scoped down to only work with Amplify-generated IAM roles. To access the GraphQL API with IAM authorization within your AppSync console, you need to explicitly allow list the IAM user's name.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

Add the allow-listed IAM users by adding them to `amplify/backend/api/<your-api-name>/custom-roles.json`. (Create the `custom-roles.json` file if it doesn't exist). Append the `adminRoleNames` array with the IAM role or user names:

```json
{
  "adminRoleNames": ["<YOUR_IAM_USER_OR_ROLE_NAME>"]
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

To grant an external AWS Resource or an IAM role access to this GraphQL API in CDK, you need to explicitly list the IAM role by adding them to `adminRoles` property.

```typescript
const userRole = Role.fromRoleName(
  this,
  'MyUserRole',
  '<INSERT YOUR USER ROLE NAME HERE>'
);

const amplifyApi = new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, 'MyNewApi', {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFiles(
    path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql')
  ),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    },
    adminRoles: [userRole] // <-- pass in the role of the console user into here to grant it access via IAM
  }
});
```

These "Admin Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

</Block>

### Using OIDC authorization provider

`private`, `owner`, and `group` authorization can be configured with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization mode. Add `provider: oidc` to the authorization rule.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI">

Upon the next `amplify push`, Amplify CLI prompts you for the _OpenID Connect provider domain_, _Client ID_, _Issued at TTL_, and _Auth Time TTL_.

</Block>
<Block name="AWS CDK">

      tokenExpiryFromIssue: '...',
      clientId: '...'
    }
  }

      { allow: group, provider: oidc, groupClaim: "user_groups" }
    ]
  ) {

}
```

The example above highlights the supported authorization strategies with `oidc` authorization provider. For `owner` and `group` authorization, you also need to [specify a custom identity and group claim](#configure-custom-identity-and-group-claims).

### Configure custom identity and group claims

`@auth` supports using custom claims if you do not wish to use the default Amazon Cognito-provided "cognito:groups" or the double-colon-delimited claims, "sub::username", from your JWT token. This can be helpful if you are using tokens from a 3rd party OIDC system or if you wish to populate a claim with a list of groups from an external system, such as when using a [Pre Token Generation Lambda Trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html) which reads from a database. To use custom claims specify `identityClaim` or `groupClaim` as appropriate like in the example below:

```graphql
type Post
  @model
  @auth(
    rules: [
      { allow: owner, identityClaim: "user_id" }
      { allow: groups, groups: ["Moderator"], groupClaim: "user_groups" }
    ]
  ) {
  id: ID!
  owner: String
  postname: String
  content: String
}
```

In this example the record owner will check against a `user_id` claim. Similarly, if the `user_groups` claim contains a "Moderator" string then access will be granted.

### Grant Lambda function access to GraphQL API

Lambda functions' IAM execution role do not immediately grant access to Amplify's GraphQL API because the API operates on a "deny-by-default"-basis. Access need to be explicitly granted. Depending on how your function is deployed, the workflow slightly differ

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Amplify CLI">

If you grant a Lambda function in your Amplify project access to the GraphQL API via `amplify update function`, then the Lambda function's IAM execution role is allow-listed to honor the permissions granted on the `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` types.

Therefore, these functions have special access privileges that are scoped based on their IAM policy instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

<Callout>

Once you grant a function access to the GraphQL API, it is required to redeploy the API to apply the permissions. To do so, run the command `amplify api gql-compile --force` before deployment via `amplify push`.

</Callout>

</Block>

<Block name="AWS CDK">
To grant an external AWS Resource or an IAM role access to this GraphQL API in CDK, you need to explicitly list the IAM role by adding them to `adminRoles` property.

```typescript
const amplifyApi = new AmplifyGraphqlApi(this, 'MyNewApi', {
  definition: AmplifyGraphqlDefinition.fromFiles(
    path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql')
  ),
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'API_KEY',
    apiKeyConfig: {
      expires: cdk.Duration.days(30)
    },
    adminRoles: [
      myFunction.role // <- Add your function's role here to grant it access to issue queries, mutations, and subscriptions
    ]
  }
});
```

These "Admin Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

</Block>

<Block name="Function deployed with other tools">

To grant an external AWS Resource or an IAM role access to this GraphQL API, you need to explicitly list the IAM role's name or the AWS Resource's name by adding it to `amplify/backend/api/<your-api-name>/custom-roles.json`. (Create the `custom-roles.json` file if it doesn't exist). Append the `adminRoleNames` array with the IAM role name or AWS Resource name:

```json
{
  "adminRoleNames": ["<YOUR_IAM_ROLE_NAME>", "<YOUR_AWS_RESOURCE_NAME>"]
}
```

You can use the symbol `${env}` to reference the current Amplify CLI environment.

These "Admin Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

### How it works

Definition of the `@auth` directive:

```graphql
# When applied to a type, augments the application with
# owner and group-based authorization rules.
directive @auth(rules: [AuthRule!]!) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
input AuthRule {
  allow: AuthStrategy!
  provider: AuthProvider
  ownerField: String # defaults to "owner" when using owner auth
  identityClaim: String # defaults to "sub::username" when using owner auth
  groupClaim: String # defaults to "cognito:groups" when using Group auth
  groups: [String] # Required when using Static Group auth
  groupsField: String # defaults to "groups" when using Dynamic Group auth
  operations: [ModelOperation] # Required for finer control
}

enum AuthStrategy {
  owner
  groups
  private
  public
  custom
}
enum AuthProvider {
  apiKey
  iam
  oidc
  userPools
  function
}
enum ModelOperation {
  create
  update
  delete
  read # Short-hand to allow "get", "list", "sync", "listen", and "search"
  get # Retrieves an individual item
  list # Retrieves a list of items
  sync # Enables ability to sync offline/online changes (including via DataStore)
  listen # Subscribes to real-time changes
  search # Enables ability to search using @searchable directive
}
```

Authorization rules consists of:

- **authorization strategy** (`allow`): who the authorization rule applies to
- **authorization provider** (`provider`): which mechanism is used to apply the authorization rule (API Key, IAM, Amazon Cognito user pool, OIDC)
- **authorized operations** (`operations`): which operations are allowed for the given strategy and provider. If not specified, `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operations are allowed.
  - **`read` operation**: `read` operation can be replaced with `get`, `list`, `sync`, `listen`, and `search` for a more granular query access

<Callout warning>

If you use DataStore instead of the API category to connect to your AppSync API, then you must allow `listen` and `sync` operations for your data model.

</Callout>

**API Keys** are best used for public APIs (or parts of your schema which you wish to be public) or prototyping, and you must specify the expiration time before deploying. **IAM** authorization uses [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to make request with policies attached to Roles. OIDC tokens provided by **Amazon Cognito user pool** or **3rd party OpenID Connect** providers can also be used for authorization, and enabling this provides a simple access control requiring users to authenticate to be granted top level access to API actions.
