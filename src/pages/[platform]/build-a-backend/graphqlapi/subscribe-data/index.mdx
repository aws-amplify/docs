In this guide, we will outline the benefits of enabling real-time data integrations and how to set up and filter these subscriptions. We will also cover how to unsubscribe from subscriptions.

Before you begin, you will need:

<InlineFilter filters={["js"]}>

- An [application connected to the API](/lib/graphqlapi/connect/q/platform/js/)
- Data already created to modify

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["react-native"]}>

- An [application connected to the API](/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started/q/platform/react-native/)
- Data already created to view

</InlineFilter>

## Set up a real-time subscription

Subscriptions is a GraphQL feature that allows the server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens. For example, you can subscribe to an event when a new record is created, updated, or deleted through the API. You can enable real-time data integration in your app with a subscription.

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api'
import * as subscriptions from './graphql/subscriptions';

const client = generateClient()

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const createSub = client.graphql(
  { query: subscriptions.onCreateTodo }
).subscribe({
  next: ({ data }) => console.log(data),
  error: (error) => console.warn(error)
});

// Subscribe to update of Todo
const updateSub = client.graphql(
   { query: subscriptions.onUpdateTodo }
  ).subscribe({
    next: ({ data }) => console.log(data),
    error: (error) => console.warn(error)
  });

// Subscribe to deletion of Todo
const deleteSub = client.graphql(
  { query: subscriptions.onDeleteTodo }
).subscribe({
  next: ({ data }) => console.log(data),
  error: (error) => console.warn(error)
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
createSub.unsubscribe();
updateSub.unsubscribe();
deleteSub.unsubscribe();
```

## Set up server-side subscription filters

Subscriptions take an optional `filter` argument to define service-side subscription filters:

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api'

const client = generateClient()

const variables = {
  filter: {
    // Only receive Todo messages where the "type" field is "Personal"
    type: { eq: "Personal" }
  }
}

const sub = client.graphql({
    query: subscriptions.onCreateTodo,
    variables
}).subscribe({
  next: ({ data }) => console.log(data),
  error: error => console.warn(error)
});
```

If you want to get all subscription events, don't specify any `filter` parameters.

<Callout>

__Limitations:__
- Specifying an empty object `{}` as a filter is **not** recommended. Using `{}` as a filter might cause inconsistent behavior based on your data model's authorization rules.
- If you are using dynamic group authorization and you authorize based on a single group per record, subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of five or fewer user groups.
- Additionally, if you authorize by using an array of groups (`groups: [String]`),
  - subscriptions are only supported if the user is part of 20 or fewer groups
  - you can only authorize 20 or fewer user groups per record

</Callout>

### Subscription connection status updates

Now that your application is set up and using subscriptions, you may want to know when the subscription is finally established, or reflect to your users when the subscription isn't healthy. You can monitor the connection state for changes through the `Hub` local eventing system.

```ts
import { CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE, ConnectionState } from 'aws-amplify/api';
import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify/utils';

Hub.listen('api', (data: any) => {
  const { payload } = data;
  if (payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE) {
    const connectionState = payload.data.connectionState as ConnectionState;
    console.log(connectionState);
  }
});
```

#### Subscription connection states

- **`Connected`** - Connected and working with no issues.
- **`ConnectedPendingDisconnect`** - The connection has no active subscriptions and is disconnecting.
- **`ConnectedPendingKeepAlive`** - The connection is open, but has missed expected keep-alive messages.
- **`ConnectedPendingNetwork`** - The connection is open, but the network connection has been disrupted. When the network recovers, the connection will continue serving traffic.
- **`Connecting`** - Attempting to connect.
- **`ConnectionDisrupted`** - The connection is disrupted and the network is available.
- **`ConnectionDisruptedPendingNetwork`** - The connection is disrupted and the network connection is unavailable.
- **`Disconnected`** - Connection has no active subscriptions and is disconnecting.

<Accordion title='Troubleshooting connection issues and automated reconnection' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Troubleshooting'>

Connections between your application and backend subscriptions can be interrupted for various reasons, including network outages or the device entering sleep mode. Your subscriptions will automatically reconnect when it becomes possible to do so.

While offline, your application will miss messages and will not automatically catch up when reconnected. Depending on your use case, you may want to take action for your app to catch up when it comes back online.

```js
import { generateClient, CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE, ConnectionState } from 'aws-amplify/api'
import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify/utils'

const client = generateClient()

const fetchRecentData = () => {
  // Retrieve some/all data from AppSync
  const allTodos = await client.graphql({ query: queries.listTodos });
}

let priorConnectionState: ConnectionState;

Hub.listen("api", (data: any) => {
  const { payload } = data;
  if (
    payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE
  ) {

    if (priorConnectionState === ConnectionState.Connecting && payload.data.connectionState === ConnectionState.Connected) {
      fetchRecentData();
    }
    priorConnectionState = payload.data.connectionState;
  }
});

const createSub = client.graphql(
  { query: subscriptions.onCreateTodo }
).subscribe({
  next: payload => // Process incoming messages
});

const updateSub = client.graphql(
  { query: subscriptions.onUpdateTodo }
).subscribe({
  next: payload => // Process incoming messages
});

const deleteSub = client.graphql(
  { query: subscriptions.onDeleteTodo }
).subscribe({
  next: payload => // Process incoming messages
});

const cleanupSubscriptions = () => {
  createSub.unsubscribe();
  updateSub.unsubscribe();
  deleteSub.unsubscribe();
}
```

<Accordion title='Create a custom GraphQL subscription by ID' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Walkthrough'>

This brief walkthrough provides additional step-by-step guidance for creating a custom GraphQL subscription that will only be connected and triggered by a mutation containing a specific ID as an argument. Take, for example, the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]){
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]){
  id: ID!
  content: String
}
```

By default, subscriptions will be created for the following mutations:

```graphql
# Post type
onCreatePost
onUpdatePost
onDeletePost

# Comment type
onCreateComment
onUpdateComment
onDeleteComment
```

One operation that is not covered is how to subscribe to comments for only a single, specific post.

Because the schema has a one-to-many relationship enabled between posts and comments, you can use the auto-generated field `postCommentsId`, which defines the relationship, to set this up in a new Subscription.

To implement this, update the schema with the following:

```graphql
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]){
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]){
  id: ID!
  content: String
  postCommentsId: ID!
}

type Subscription {
  onCommentByPostId(postCommentsId: ID!): Comment
    @aws_subscribe(mutations: ["createComment"])
}

```

Now you can create a custom subscription for comment creation with a specific post ID:

```js
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api'
import { onCommentByPostId } from './graphql/subscriptions';

const client = generateClient()

client.graphql({
  query: onCommentByPostId,
  variables: {
    postCommentsId: "12345"
  }
})
.subscribe({
  next: data => {
    console.log('data: ', data)
  }
})
```

</Accordion>

## Unsubscribe from a subscription

You can also unsubscribe from events by using subscriptions by implementing the following:

```ts
// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
sub.unsubscribe();
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the **Subscribe to real-time events** guide. In this guide, you set up subscriptions for real-time events and learned how to filter and cancel these subscriptions when needed.
