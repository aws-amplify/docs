<InlineFilter filters={["android", "swift"]}>

API (GraphQL) has the capability to handle relationships between Models, such as _has one_, _has many_, and _belongs to_. In Amplify GraphQL APIs, this is done with the `@hasOne`, `@hasMany` and `@belongsTo` directives as defined in the [GraphQL data modeling documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/data-modeling/).

By default, GraphQL APIs requests generate a selection set with a depth of 0. Connected relationship models are not returned in the initial request, but can be lazily loaded as needed with an additional API request. We provide mechanisms to customize the selection set, which allows connected relationships to be eagerly loaded on the initial request.

## Prerequisites

The following examples have a minimum version requirement of the following:

<InlineFilter filters={["android"]}>

- Amplify CLI v12.7.0
- Amplify Android Library v2.14.0
- This guide uses updated model types generated by the Amplify CLI. To follow this guide, locate `"generatemodelsforlazyloadandcustomselectionset"` in `{project-directory}/amplify/cli.json` and set the value to `true`.

<Callout>

If you already have relational models in your project, you must re-run `amplify codegen models` after updating the feature flag. After the models have been updated, breaking changes will need to be addressed because relationship fields will now be wrapped in `ModelList`/`ModelReference` types. Follow the rest of the guide on this page information on how to use the new lazy supported models.

</Callout>

<InlineFilter filters={["swift"]}>

- Amplify Library for Swift v2.4.0
- This guide uses updated model types generated by the Amplify CLI. To follow this guide, locate `"generatemodelsforlazyloadandcustomselectionset"` in `{project-directory}/amplify/cli.json` and set the value to `true`.

## Create a GraphQL schema with relationships between models

For the following example, let's add a Post and Comment model to the [schema](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api/#creating-your-first-api-and-database-table):

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  rating: Int!
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  post: Post @belongsTo
}
```

Generate the models for the updated schema using the [Amplify CLI](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api/).

```bash
amplify codegen models
```

## Creating relationships

In order to create connected models, you will create an instance of the model you wish to connect and pass it to `Amplify.API.mutate`:

Post post = Post.builder()

    .content("Loving Amplify API!")
    .build();

Amplify.API.mutate(ModelMutation.create(post),
    savedPost -> {
        Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Post created.");
        Amplify.API.mutate(ModelMutation.create(comment),

In order to handle the loaded/lazy states of relationships, the code generated models wrap relationships in `ModelReference` and `ModelList` types.

```java
public final class Post implements Model {

  public ModelList<Comment> getComments()
}

public final class Comment implements Model {

  public ModelReference<Post> getPost()
}
```

ModelReference and ModelList types are either Lazy (Default) or Loaded. See [Customizing Query Depth](#customizing-query-depth-with-custom-selection-sets) to learn how to eagerly load connected relationships.

  - LazyModelReference\<M\>

Always call `fetch()` to load or retrieve the comments. If the comments were loaded as part of the query, it will return immediately. See [Customizing Query Depth](#customizing-query-depth-with-custom-selection-sets) to learn how to eagerly load connected relationships.

## Many-to-many relationships

For many-to-many relationships, you can use the `@manyToMany` directive and specify a `relationName`. Under the hood, Amplify creates a join table and a one-to-many relationship from both models.

<Callout warning>

Join table records must be deleted prior to deleting the associated records. For example, for a many-to-many relationship between `Post`s and `Tag`s, delete the `PostTag`s join record prior to deleting a `Post` or `Tag`.

</Callout>

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  rating: Int
  editors: [User] @manyToMany(relationName: "PostEditor")
}

type User @model {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  posts: [Post] @manyToMany(relationName: "PostEditor")

This example illustrates the complexity of working with multiple sequential create operations. To remove the nested callbacks, consider using Amplify's support for [Coroutines](/[platform]/start/project-setup/kotlin-coroutines/).

## Customizing query depth with custom selection sets

You can perform a nested query through one network request, by specifying which connected models to include. This is achieved by using the optional `includes` parameter for a GraphQL request.

Query for the `Comment` and the `Post` that it belongs to:

<InlineFilter filters={["android"]}>

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Java">

```java
Amplify.API.query(
    ModelQuery.<Comment, CommentPath>get(
        Comment.class,
        new Comment.CommentIdentifier("c1"),
        (commentPath -> includes(commentPath.getPost()))
    ),
    response -> {
        Comment comment = response.getData();
        ModelReference<Post> postReference = comment.getPost();
        if (postReference instanceof LoadedModelReference) {
            Post post = ((LoadedModelReference<Post>) postReference).getValue();
            Log.i("MyAmplifyApp", "Post: " + post);
        }
    },
    failure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Failed to fetch post", failure)
);
```

This will populate the selection set of the post in the GraphQL document which indicates to your GraphQL service to retrieve the post model as part of the operation. Once the comment is loaded, the post model is immediately available in-memory without requiring an additional network request.

Amplify.API.query(
    ModelQuery.get<Comment, CommentPath>(
        Comment::class.java,

        includes(commentPath.post)
