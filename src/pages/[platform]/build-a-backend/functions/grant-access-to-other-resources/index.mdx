In order for Amplify Functions to interact with other resources they must be given access. There are two ways to grant Amplify Functions access to other resources:

1. [Using the `access` property](#using-the-access-property)
2. [Using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](#using-cdk)

## Using the `access` property

The `access` property is a property found in each of the `define*` functions for defining Amplify resources. It allows you specify the necessary actions using common language.

<Callout>

When you grant a function access to another resource in your Amplify backend ([such as granting access to storage](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/#resource-access)), it will configure environment variables for that function to make SDK calls to the AWS services it has access to. Those environment variables are typed and available as part of the `env` object.

</Callout>

Say you have a function that generates reports each month from your Data resource and needs to store the generated reports in Storage:

```ts title="amplify/storage/resource.ts"
import { defineStorage } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { generateMonthlyReports } from '../functions/generate-monthly-reports/resource';

export const storage = defineStorage({
  name: 'myReports',
  access: (allow) => ({
    'reports/*': [
      allow.resource(generateMonthlyReports).to(['read', 'write', 'delete'])
    ]
  })
});
```

This access definition will add the environment variable `myReports_BUCKET_NAME` to the function. This environment variable can be accessed on the `env` object.

Here's an example of how it can be used to upload some content to S3.

```ts title="amplify/functions/generate-monthly-reports/handler.ts"
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { env } from '$amplify/env/generate-monthly-reports';

const s3Client = new S3Client();

export const handler = async () => {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: env.MY_REPORTS_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: `reports/${new Date().toISOString()}.csv`,
    Body: new Blob([''], { type: 'text/csv;charset=utf-8;' })
  });

  await s3Client.send(command);
};
```

## Using CDK

When permissions are needed to access resources beyond the capabilities of the `access` property, you must use CDK.

Functions are created with an [_execution role_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html), which is an IAM role that contains policies that dictate what resources your Function can interact with when it executes. This role can be extended using the [`addToRolePolicy()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda.IFunction.html#addwbrtowbrrolewbrpolicystatement) method:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from "@aws-amplify/backend"
import * as iam from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam"
import * as sns from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns"
import { weeklyDigest } from "./functions/weekly-digest/resource"

const backend = defineBackend({
  weeklyDigest,
})

const weeklyDigestLambda = backend.weeklyDigest.resources.lambda

const topicStack = backend.createStack("WeeklyDigest")
const topic = new sns.Topic(topicStack, "Topic", {
  displayName: "digest",
})

// highlight-start
const statement = new iam.PolicyStatement({
  sid: "AllowPublishToDigest",
  actions: ["sns:Publish"],
  resources: [topic.topicArn],
})

weeklyDigestLambda.addToRolePolicy(statement)
  // highlight-end
```

However some constructs provide a `grant*` method to grant access to common policy actions. Revisiting the example above you can grant the same access with `grantPublish`:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from "@aws-amplify/backend"
import * as sns from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns"
import { weeklyDigest } from "./functions/weekly-digest/resource"

const backend = defineBackend({
  weeklyDigest,
})

const weeklyDigestLambda = backend.weeklyDigest.resources.lambda

const topicStack = backend.createStack("WeeklyDigest")
const topic = new sns.Topic(topicStack, "Topic", {
  displayName: "digest"
})

// highlight-next-line
topic.grantPublish(weeklyDigestLambda)
```
