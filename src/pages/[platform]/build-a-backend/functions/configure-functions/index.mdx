`defineFunction` comes out-of-the-box with sensible but minimal defaults. The following options are provided to tweak the function configuration.

<Callout info>

**Note:** The following options are not supported for [Custom Functions](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/custom-functions/) except for `resourceGroupName`.

</Callout>

## `name`

By default, functions are named based on the directory the `defineFunction` call is placed in. In the above example, defining the function in `amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts` will cause the function to be named `my-demo-function` by default.

If an entry is specified, then the name defaults to the basename of the entry path. For example, an `entry` of `./signup-trigger-handler.ts` would cause the function name to default to `signup-trigger-handler`.

This optional property can be used to explicitly set the name of the function.

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  entry: './demo-function-handler.ts',
  name: 'overrideName' // explicitly set the name to override the default naming behavior
});
```

## `timeoutSeconds`

By default, functions will time out after 3 seconds. This can be configured to any whole number of seconds up to 15 minutes.

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  // highlight-next-line
  timeoutSeconds: 60 // 1 minute timeout
});
```

## `memoryMB`

By default, functions have 512 MB of memory allocated to them. This can be configured from 128 MB up to 10240 MB. Note that this can increase the cost of function invocation. For more pricing information see [here](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/).

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  // highlight-next-line
  memoryMB: 256 // allocate 256 MB of memory to the function.
});
```

## `ephemeralStorageSizeMB`

By default, functions have 512MB of ephemeral storage to them. This can be configured from 512 MB upto 10240 MB. Note that this can increase the cost of function invocation. For more pricing information visit the [Lambda pricing documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/).

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  // highlight-next-line
  ephemeralStorageSizeMB: 1024 // allocate 1024 MB of ephemeral storage to the function.
});
```

## `runtime`

Currently, only Node runtimes are supported by `defineFunction`. However, you can change the Node version that is used by the function. The default is the oldest Node LTS version that is supported by AWS Lambda (currently Node 18).

If you wish to use an older version of Node, keep an eye on the [Lambda Node version deprecation schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html). As Lambda removes support for old Node versions, you will have to update to newer supported versions.

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  runtime: 20 // use Node 20
});
```

## `entry`

By default, Amplify will look for your function handler in a file called `handler.ts` in the same directory as the file where `defineFunction` is called. To point to a different handler location, specify an `entry` value.

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  entry: './path/to/handler.ts' // this path should either be absolute or relative to the current file
});
```

## `resourceGroupName`

By default, functions are grouped together in a resource group named `function`. You can override this to group related function with other Amplify resources like `auth`, `data`, `storage`, or separate them into your own custom group.
This is typically useful when you have resources that depend on each other and you want to group them together.

```ts title="amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts"
export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  resourceGroupName: 'data'
});
```
