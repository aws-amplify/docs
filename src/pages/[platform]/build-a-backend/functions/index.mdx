**Under active development:** The Functions experience for Amplify (Gen 2) is under active development. The experience may change between versions of `@aws-amplify/backend`. Try it out and provide feedback at https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-backend/issues/new/choose

To create a function, start by creating a file `amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts`. Paste the following content into the file.

```ts
// amplify/functions/my-demo-function/resource.ts
import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const myDemoFunction = defineFunction({
  /*
    name?: string // optional parameter to specify a function name. In this case, it will default to "my-demo-function" (the name of the directory where the function is defined)
    entry?: string // optional path to the function code. Defaults to ./handler.ts
  */
});
```

Next, create `amplify/functions/my-demo-function/handler.ts`. This is where your function code will go.

```ts
// amplify/functions/my-demo-function/handler.ts

export const handler = async (event) => {
  // your function code goes here
  return 'You made a function!';
};
```

The handler file _must_ export an async function named "handler". This is the entry point to your function. For more information on writing functions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html

Lastly, this function needs to be added to your backend.

```ts
// amplify/backend.ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { myDemoFunction } from './functions/my-demo-function/resource';

defineBackend({
  myDemoFunction
});
```

Now when you run `npx amplify sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will include your backend function. However, just defining a function doesn't do a whole lot. We need a way to invoke the function based on some event or request. Let's take a look at some examples to see how we can do this.

## Example - Create a Function trigger for Auth

Auth has several events that can trigger functions to perform custom sign up, sign in and other tasks. In this example you will configure a "preSignUp" trigger.

First, in your auth definition, add the following:

```ts
// amplify/auth/resource.ts

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  },
  triggers: {
    // configure a trigger to point to a function definition
    preSignUp: defineFunction({
      entry: './pre-sign-up-handler.ts'
    });
  }
});
```

Then create the function definition at `amplify/auth/pre-sign-up-handler.ts`.

```ts
// amplify/auth/pre-sign-up-handler.ts
import type { PreSignUpTriggerHandler } from 'aws-lambda';

export const handler: PreSignUpTriggerHandler = async (event) => {
  // your code here
};
```

<Callout info>

**Note:** The `PreSignUpTriggerHandler` type comes from the [@types/aws-lambda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/aws-lambda) NPM package. This package contains types for different kinds of Lambda handlers, events, and responses.

</Callout>

Assuming that your auth definition is already added to your backend, you don't need to explicitly add your preSignUp function to the `defineBackend` properties. Since the preSignUp function is attached to the auth definition, Amplify is able to figure out that the function should be included in the deployment.

Now when you deploy your app and a user signs up, this Lambda will fire before the signup.

## Example - Use a function resolver in your data model

See [Custom business logic](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic/)

## Example - Use a function as a custom authorizer in your data model

See [Custom data access patterns](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/custom-data-access-patterns/)

### Scheduled jobs

We're actively working on a feature to trigger functions on a recurring schedule.

### More function configuration

You'll soon be able to customize function configuration like memory size, timeout, environment variables, access secret values and more. Keep your `@aws-amplify/backend` package up to date and come back to see what's new.
