Amplify Functions are powered by [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and allow you to perform a wide variety of customization through self-contained _functions_. Functions can respond to events from other resources, execute some logic in-between events like an authentication flow, or act as standalone jobs. They are used in a variety of settings and use cases:

- Authentication flow customizations (e.g. attribute validations, allowlisting email domains)
- Resolvers for GraphQL APIs
- Handlers for individual REST API routes, or to host an entire API
- Scheduled jobs

To get started, create a new directory and a resource file, `amplify/functions/say-hello/resource.ts`. Then, define the Function with `defineFunction`:

```ts title="amplify/functions/say-hello/resource.ts"
import { defineFunction } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const sayHello = defineFunction({
  // optionally specify a name for the Function (defaults to directory name)
  name: 'say-hello',
  // optionally specify a path to your handler (defaults to "./handler.ts")
  entry: './handler.ts'
});
```

Next, create the corresponding handler file at `amplify/functions/say-hello/handler.ts`. This is where your function code will go.

```ts title="amplify/functions/say-hello/handler.ts"
export const handler = async (event) => {
  // your function code goes here
  return 'Hello, World!';
};
```

The handler file _must_ export a function named "handler". This is the entry point to your function. For more information on writing functions, refer to the [AWS documentation for Lambda function handlers using Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-handler.html).

Lastly, this function needs to be added to your backend.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
// highlight-next-line
import { sayHello } from './functions/say-hello/resource';

defineBackend({
  // highlight-next-line
  sayHello
});
```

Now when you run `npx ampx sandbox` or deploy your app on Amplify, it will include your backend function. See the [examples](../examples/) below for connecting your functions to event sources.

## Next steps

Now that you have completed setting up your first Function, you may also want to add some additional features or modify a few settings. We recommend you learn more about:

- [Environment variables and secrets](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/environment-variables-and-secrets/)
- [Grant access to other resources](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/grant-access-to-other-resources/)
- [Explore example use cases](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/examples/)
- [Modifying underlying resources with CDK](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/modify-resources-with-cdk/)
