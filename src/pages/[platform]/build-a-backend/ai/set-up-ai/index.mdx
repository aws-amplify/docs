In this guide, you will learn how to set up Amplify AI. This includes building Conversation and Generation routes, and securing access to these routes with authorization rules.

Before you begin, you will need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.16.0 or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14.4 or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later

With Amplify AI, you can define Conversation and Generation routes backed by an AWS AppSync API and Amazon Bedrock.

## Building your AI backend
If you've run `npm create amplify@latest` already, you should see an `amplify/data/resource/ts` file, which is the central location to configure your AI backend. Within the `schema` object, you define Conversation routes (`a.conversation({})`) and Generation routes (`a.generation({})`), and can integrate them seamlessly with existing Amplify Data schema objects.

```ts title="amplify/data/resources.ts"
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({
});
```
