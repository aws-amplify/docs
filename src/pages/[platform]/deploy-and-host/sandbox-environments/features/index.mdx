Sandbox environments include additional features for managing secrets, deploying multiple sandboxes, config generation, and client codegen for your Amplify app.

## Secure secrets in your sandbox

<Callout info>
  Secrets set in a sandbox do not show up in the Amplify Console. You can view them in the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store console.
</Callout>

Amplify Gen 2 offers secure secret storage to manage sensitive data like API keys and database credentials. Secrets are similar to environment variables, but they are encrypted AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store key value pairs. Secrets are stored in AWS Parameter Store with the following naming convention: `/amplify/<package.json#name>/<sandbox-name>/<key-name>`.

### Set secrets

You can add secrets while running your cloud sandbox with the following command:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox secret set foo
? Enter secret value: ###
Done!

> npx amplify sandbox secret set bar
? Enter secret value: ###
Done!
```

### Access secrets

Once you have set a secret, you can access the values in code by calling the `secret()` function. The following example shows how to set up social sign-in with authentication in your app. Depending on your environment, Amplify will automatically load the correct secret value with no extra configuration.

```ts
import { defineAuth, secret } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      facebook: {
        // highlight-start
        clientId: secret('foo'),
        clientSecret: secret('bar')
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Retrieve secrets

To get the value of a secret from the cloud, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox secret get foo
 name: foo
 version: 1
 value: 123
 lastUpdated: Mon Nov 13 2023 22:19:12 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

### Remove secrets

To remove a secret from the cloud, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox secret remove foo
```

### Work with multiple AWS profiles

Sometimes you might have multiple AWS profiles set up locally. To run `amplify sandbox secret` commands, use the `--profile` flag to deploy to a specific profile. For example, let's say you have two AWS profiles set up locallyâ€”`default` and `work`. To add secrets to the `work` profile, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox secret set foo --profile work
```

## Multiple sandboxes per app

<Callout info>
  Provisioning multiple sandboxes per app is possible but not recommended because managing multiple ephemeral environments for a single app introduces complexity. With multiple sandboxes, it can be difficult to keep track of what code version or configuration is deployed where. Sticking to a single ephemeral sandbox per app keeps your workflows simple and straightforward.
</Callout>

You can create multiple cloud sandbox environments for each app if you want to keep persistent sandbox environments up and running to test against. First, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --name s1
```

Once the deployment completes, exit sandbox `s1` and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --name s2
```

After successful deployment, sandboxes `s1` and `s2` will be ready. Pick sandbox `s1` or `s2` to activate. You can switch between them but only one can be running at a time.

## Generate client config

The client config (e.g. `amplifyconfiguration.json` file for Web) contains the configuration strings for interacting with AWS resources specific to an environment. The Amplify client libraries need the client config file in order to use the library APIs to connect to backend resources. By default, the cloud sandbox generates the client configuration file at the root of the project (such as `@/amplifyconfiguration.json`). If you want to place the file at a different path you can use the following command template:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --config-out-dir path/to/config --config-format ["mjs", "json", "json-mobile", "ts", "dart"]
```

### Sandbox Environment

For Web and React Native, generating the client in the root of the project would work, but all the other platforms have specific directories to target.

<InlineFilter filters={['angular','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','swift','vue']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --config-format dart --config-out-dir lib
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
<Callout warning>
  Be sure to add a "raw" folder under app/src/main/res directory if it doesn't
  exist.
</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile --config-out-dir app/src/main/res/raw
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile
```

Once the sandbox environment is running, you would also generate the configuration files for your application. However, Xcode won't be able to recognize them. For recognizing the files, you need to drag and drop the generated files to your project.

  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/ios/ios-getting-started-2.mp4" />
</video>
</InlineFilter>

### Deployment Environment

Alternatively, if you want to generate the config for a branch environment to test against, you can run the following command below in the terminal:

<InlineFilter filters={['android','angular','flutter','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','swift','vue']}>
For Web and React Native, generating the config with the default format and output directory.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <app-id> --branch main
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <app-id> --branch main --format dart --out-dir lib
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
<Callout warning>
  Be sure to add a "raw" folder under app/src/main/res directory if it doesn't
  exist.
</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <app-id> --branch main --format json-mobile --out-dir app/src/main/res/raw
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <app-id> --format json-mobile
```

Once the sandbox environment is running, you would also generate the configuration files for your application. However, Xcode won't be able to recognize them. For recognizing the files, you need to drag and drop the generated files to your project.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/ios/ios-getting-started-2.mp4" />
</video>

</InlineFilter>

## Generate client codegen

<Callout info>
  Amplify Gen 2 introduces a fully typed experience for data that no longer requires an explicit codegen step, unlike in Amplify Gen 1. You will only need this command if you are building a mobile app or have Gen 1 requirements.
</Callout>

Codegen generates native code for Swift (iOS), Java (Android), and JavaScript that represents your GraphQL API's data models. It can also generate GraphQL statements (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) so that you don't have to manually code them.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate graphql-client-code --format [choices: "modelgen", "graphql-codegen", "introspection"]
```

Once your sandbox completes a deployment, you can run the following command in the terminal to generate client code that is specific to your needs:

<InlineFilter filters={['angular','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','vue']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate graphql-client-code --format modelgen
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate graphql-client-code --format modelgen --model-target java --out app/src/main/java
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate graphql-client-code --format modelgen --model-target dart --out lib/models
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate graphql-client-code --format modelgen
```

Move the generated files to your project. You can do this by dragging and dropping the files to your project.

![Dialog appears when users drag and drop the generated files into Xcode. It displays targets, added folders, and destination options. The default settings should be sufficient for drag and drop.](/images/lib/getting-started/ios/set-up-swift-8.png)

## Delete a sandbox

You can delete a cloud sandbox environment in several ways:

1. Ctrl+C your sandbox and choose to delete resources.
1. Run `npx amplify sandbox delete` or `npx amplify sandbox delete --name`
1. Visit the Amplify console and [delete sandboxes](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/sandbox-environments/setup/#manage-sandbox-environments).
