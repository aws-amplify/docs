Sandbox environments include additional features for managing secrets, deploying multiple sandboxes, config generation, and client codegen for your Amplify app.

## Secure secrets in your sandbox

<Callout info>

  Secrets set in a sandbox do not show up in the Amplify Console. You can view them in the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store console.
  
</Callout>

Amplify Gen 2 offers secure secret storage to manage sensitive data like API keys and database credentials. Secrets are similar to environment variables, but they are encrypted AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store key value pairs. Secrets are stored in AWS Parameter Store under the `/amplify` prefix.

### Set secrets

You can add secrets to your sandbox environment using the following command:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox secret set foo
? Enter secret value: ###
Done!

npx ampx sandbox secret set bar
? Enter secret value: ###
Done!
```

After these commands, your sandbox will have two secrets named `foo` and `bar`.

### List secrets

You can list all of the secret names available in your sandbox environment with the following command:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox secret list
 - foo
 - bar
```

### Retrieve a secret

<Callout warning>

**Note:** This will print a secret value in plain text to the terminal. Do not use this command anywhere that terminal logs may be stored (such as CI/CD jobs).

</Callout>

To show the value of a secret, run the following command.

```bash
npx ampx sandbox secret get foo
name: foo
version: 1
value: abc123
lastUpdated: Mon Nov 13 2023 22:19:12 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

### Remove secrets

To remove a secret from from the sandbox, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox secret remove foo
```

### Reference secrets

Once you have set a secret, you can reference the secret in your backend definition using the `secret()` function. The following example shows how to set up social sign-in with authentication in your app. Depending on your environment, Amplify will automatically load the correct secret value.

```ts
import { defineAuth, secret } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    externalProviders: {
      facebook: {
        // highlight-start
        clientId: secret('foo'),
        clientSecret: secret('bar')
        // highlight-end
      }
    }
  }
});
```

The `secret()` function does NOT retrieve the value of the secret. It places a reference to the secret value in the backend definition. The secret value is only resolved during deployment of your backend.

The `secret()` function can only be used in specific places in your backend definition such as [configuring auth providers](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/concepts/external-identity-providers) and [function secrets](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/environment-variables-and-secrets/#accessing-environment-variables).

<Callout info>

To deploy a backend that uses `secret()` references via Amplify hosting, the secret values must be [configured for the Amplify app or branch](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars)

</Callout>

## Work with multiple AWS profiles

Sometimes you might have multiple AWS profiles set up locally. To run `ampx sandbox secret` commands, use the `--profile` flag to deploy to a specific profile. For example, let's say you have two AWS profiles set up locally—`default` and `work`. To add secrets to the sandbox in the `work` profile, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox secret set foo --profile work
```

## Work with multiple named sandboxes

<Callout info>

Provisioning multiple sandboxes per app is possible but not recommended because managing multiple ephemeral environments for a single developer introduces complexity. With multiple sandboxes, it can be difficult to keep track of what code version or configuration is deployed where. Sticking to a single sandbox per developer keeps your workflows simpler.

</Callout>

You can create multiple sandboxes if you want to have different features or test environments available in different sandboxes. By default, your sandbox is named based on the local machine username. To override this name, use the `--identifier` option:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox --identifier feature1sandbox
```

This will start a sandbox named `feature1sandbox`.

Once the deployment completes, exit sandbox and run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox --identifier feature2sandbox
```

After successful deployment, you will have two sandboxes `feature1sandbox` and `feature2sandbox`. You can switch between them but only one can be running at a time.

### Secret management with named sandboxes

When working with multiple sandboxes, secrets must be configured for each one. All of the `sandbox secret` commands accept the `--identifier` argument to manage secrets for named sandboxes. For example, to add a secret to `feature1sandbox`, use:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox --identifier feature1sandbox secret set baz
```

## Stream function logs

Amplify offers the ability to stream function logs directly to your terminal or a file. [Learn more about streaming function logs](/[platform]/build-a-backend/functions/streaming-logs/).

## Generate client config

The client config, or `amplify_outputs.json` file, contains the configuration strings for interacting with AWS resources specific to an environment. The Amplify client libraries need the client config in order to use the library APIs to connect to backend resources. By default, the cloud sandbox generates the client configuration file at the root of the project (such as `@/amplify_outputs.json`). If you want to place the file at a different path (such as for a monorepo or Android app), run the following command in the terminal:

<InlineFilter filters={['angular','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','vue']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-out-dir ./path/to/config --outputs-format ["json", "dart"]
```

Alternatively, if you want to generate the config for a branch environment to test against, run the following command in the terminal.

```bash
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <your-amplify-app-id> --branch main --format ["json", "dart"] --out-dir ./path/to/config
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format dart --outputs-out-dir lib
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
<Callout warning>
  Be sure to add a "raw" folder under app/src/main/res directory if it doesn't
  exist.
</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format json-mobile --outputs-out-dir app/src/main/res/raw
```
</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format json-mobile
```

Once the sandbox environment is running, you would also generate the configuration files for your application. However, Xcode won't be able to recognize them. For recognizing the files, you need to drag and drop the generated files to your project.

### Deployment Environment

Alternatively, if you want to generate the config for a branch environment to test against, you can run the following command below in the terminal:

<InlineFilter filters={['android','angular','flutter','javascript','nextjs','react','react-native','swift','vue']}>
For Web and React Native, generating the config with the default format and output directory.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <app-id> --branch main
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['flutter']}>
```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <app-id> --branch main --format dart --out-dir lib
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['android']}>
<Callout warning>
  Be sure to add a "raw" folder under app/src/main/res directory if it doesn't
  exist.
</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <app-id> --branch main --out-dir app/src/main/res/raw
```
</InlineFilter>
<InlineFilter filters={['swift']}>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx generate outputs --app-id <app-id> --format json-mobile
```

Once the sandbox environment is running, it will generate the backend outputs file for your frontend application. However, Xcode won't be able to recognize them. For recognizing the files, you need to drag and drop the generated files to your project.

## Generate client codegen

<Callout info>

Amplify Gen 2 introduces a fully typed experience for data that no longer requires an explicit codegen step, unlike in Amplify Gen 1. You will only need this command if you are building a mobile app or have Gen 1 requirements.

</Callout>

Codegen generates native code for Swift (iOS), Java (Android), and JavaScript that represents your GraphQL API's data models. It can also generate GraphQL statements (queries, mutations, and subscriptions) so that you don't have to manually code them.

Once your sandbox completes a deployment, you can run the following command in the terminal to generate client code that is specific to your needs:

```bash
npx ampx generate graphql-client-code
--format [choices: "modelgen", "graphql-codegen", "introspection"]
```

## Delete a sandbox

You can delete a cloud sandbox environment in several ways:

1. Ctrl+C your sandbox and choose to delete resources.
1. Run `npx ampx sandbox delete` or `npx ampx sandbox delete --name`
1. Visit the Amplify console and [delete sandboxes](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/sandbox-environments/setup/#manage-sandbox-environments).
