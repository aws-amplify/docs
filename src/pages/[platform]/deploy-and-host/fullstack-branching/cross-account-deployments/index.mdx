This guide walks you through how to create a trunk-based, multi-region deployment pipeline for applications built using AWS Amplify Gen 2. We will be using Amazon CodeCatalyst and AWS Amplify Hosting in this guide, but you can choose any CI/CD provider.

<Callout info>

**Note**: You can deploy this custom pipeline either in the us-west-2 or eu-west-1 Regions, as Amazon CodeCatalyst is currently only available in those two [AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/codecatalyst.html).

</Callout>

## Step 1: Set up an Amazon CodeCatalyst space

Please refer to this Amazon CodeCatalyst [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/setting-up-topnode.html) for a detailed step-by-step walkthrough to set up your [space](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/spaces.html).

## Step 2: Deploy a fullstack Amplify Gen 2 app

<InlineFilter filters={["nextjs"]}>

 - Use our [**Next.js starter template**](/[platform]/start/quickstart/nextjs-pages-router/#1-create-the-repository) to create a repository in your GitHub account.
- Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/).
- Navigate to the Amplify console and select [**Create new app**](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/create).
- Select the **next-pages-template** repository, then select **Next**.
- Review the details on the **Create Git Repository** page, then select **Save and deploy**.
- Done! You have successfully deployed a fullstack Gen 2 app. You can review the status of the app deployment in the Amplify console.

## Step 3: Update build specification

Add the `npx ampx generate outputs --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID` command to the build spec and comment out the `npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID` command. `ampx pipeline-deploy` runs a script to deploy backend updates, while `ampx generate outputs` fetches the latest `amplify_outputs.json` for the specified environment.

## Step 4: Disable automatic builds on the branch

You can configure Amplify to disable automatic builds on every code commit. Navigate to the app in the Amplify console. Under **App settings**, select **Branch settings**. From the **Branches** section, select the branch and then choose **Disable auto build** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

<Video src="/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/auto-build.mp4" description="Video - Disable automatic builds on the branch" />

## Step 5: Create an incoming webhook

You can set up an incoming webhook to trigger a build without committing code to your Git repository. Use the Amplify Console to create an [incoming webhook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/webhooks.html).

Navigate to the app, under **Hosting > Build settings** select **Create webhook**. Provide a **name** for the webhook and select the **target branch** to build on incoming webhook requests.

![Screenshot of the Build settings page in the Amplify console showing the incoming webhooks feature](/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/multirepo5.png)

Next, select the webhook and copy the `curl` command which will be used to trigger a build for the app.

![Screenshot of the Incoming webhooks page in the Amplify console displaying the newly created webhook](/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/multirepo6.png)

## Step 6: Create a new Amazon CodeCatalyst project

Please refer to this Amazon CodeCatalyst [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/projects-create.html#projects-create-github) for a detailed step-by-step walkthrough to create a new [project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/projects.html).

<Callout info>

**Note**: When creating your project, select the **next-pages-template** GitHub repository, which we used to deploy the app in Step 2.

</Callout>

## Step 7: Set up the resources in a different or target AWS account

To achieve a cross-account deployment, you will need to implement Steps 1 through 6 outlined previously in this guide in a different AWS account (for example, `production` account).

## Step 8: Add the target AWS account to the CodeCatalyst space

Navigate to the CodeCatalyst space created as part of Step 1, select **Settings**, and then select **AWS accounts**. Add the target **AWS account ID** (Step 7) to it and select **Associate AWS account**.

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing details of the Associate AWS account section](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline12.png)

You will also need to create an IAM role in the target AWS account which will be assumed by the `staging` environment to perform actions and deploy resources in the `production` environment. As a best practice, we recommend attaching the [`AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess) AWS managed policy to the IAM role as it contains all the required permissions to deploy Gen 2 resources in your account. You can learn more about adding IAM roles to account connections in the CodeCatalyst [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/ipa-connect-account-addroles.html).

## Step 9: Create a workflow in the Amazon CodeCatalyst project

A workflow is an automated procedure that describes how to build, test, and deploy your code as part of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) system. You can learn more about workflows in the [Amazon CodeCatalyst User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/flows.html).

- Within the CodeCatalyst project, navigate to the **CI/CD** feature and select **Workflows**.
- Select **Create workflow**.
- Choose the **next-pages-template** GitHub repository and the branch **main** from the dropdown menu.
- Next, select **Create**.

![Screenshot of the CodeCatalyst console showing details of the Create workflow dialog box](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline3.png)

Once you create the workflow, you should see a **yaml** editor in the CodeCatalyst console.

![Screenshot of yaml editor in CodeCatalyst console](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline4.png)

Switch the experience in the console to the **Visual** editor. Select the **Actions** button to see a list of workflow actions that you can add to your workflow.

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing the Workflows section with +Actions highlighted](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline5.png)

Add the **Build** action to the workflow and select the **Add variable** button in the **Inputs** section. Add the following environment variables to it:

- AWS_APP_ID_STAGING: `amplify app id for staging app`
- AWS_APP_ID_PRODUCTION: `amplify app id for production app`
- AWS_BRANCH: `git branch name`

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing the Workflows section, focusing on Inputs for the build](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline13.png)

Add another **Build** action to the workflow and select the **Depends on** button in the **Inputs** section. From the dropdown menu, select the name of the previous build action to set up the pipeline.

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing the Workflows section, focusing on the visual workflow and the Inputs section](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline14.png)

Next, select the **Configuration** section and add the following information to each of the build actions:

- Environment information (optional): `staging, production, etc.`
- AWS account connection: `your account connection`
- Role: `role setup with your account connection`

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing the Workflows section, focusing on the Configuration section](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline8.png)

You will then need to add the following shell commands to each of the build actions:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
// This environment variable is required to run the pipeline-deploy command in a non Amplify CI environment
- Run: export CI=1

// Perform a clean install of the dependencies
- Run: npm ci

// Deploy the backend for your Amplify Gen 2 app
- Run: npx ampx pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID

// Trigger frontend build using incoming webhooks
- Run: if [ $AWS_BRANCH = "main" ]; then curl -X POST -d {} "`webhookUrl`&operation=startbuild" -H "Content-Type:application/json"; fi
```

You can now run **Validate** to ensure your workflow definition `yaml` file is valid. Lastly, select **Commit** to save your changes.

<Callout info>

**Note**: Since workflows are saved as commits, and this workflow has a code push trigger enabled, committing the workflow will automatically start a new workflow run.

</Callout>

Next, you can review the result of the workflow run from the **Runs** tab:

![Screenshot of CodeCatalyst console showing the Workflows section, focusing on the Runs tab](images/gen2/cross-account-deployments/pipeline11.png)

Done! You have successfully set up a custom cross-account pipeline to deploy your frontend and backend for apps built using Amplify Gen 2. To summarize, this custom pipeline will enable you to deploy your backend initially with your `staging` environment using `ampx pipeline-deploy` in the CodeCatalyst workflow and `ampx generate outputs` will generate the `amplify_outputs.json` file for the `main` branch. Amplify Hosting will not deploy backend resources as part of the build and instead will use the deployed backend resources from the `main` branch. Once the staging environment deploys successfully, a similar process will be followed to deploy your `production` environment in a different AWS account.
