In some instances, you may not want to deploy new resources for every branch. For example, you might want all your `feature` branches to point to the backend resources deployed by the `dev` branch so you can reuse seed data, users, and groups.

You can update your app build settings to share resources across branches. In the Amplify console, select your app on the **All apps** page. From the **App overview** page, select **Hosting > Build settings** to view your app's build specification YML file.

Update the build settings for the `backend` phase to run `npx amplify generate config --branch dev app-id $AWS_APP_ID` to generate the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file for all branches other than `main` or `dev`. After this update, any new deployed branches will not deploy backend resources as part of the build and instead will use the deployed backend resources from the `dev` branch.
