In some instances, you may not want to deploy new resources for every branch. For example, you might want all your `feature` branches to point to the backend resources deployed by the `dev` branch so you can reuse seed data, users, and groups.

![Main and dev environments, each with their own backend resources. In the dev environment, two feature branches are shown sharing the same backend resources. ](/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/share-resources.png)

You can update your app build settings to share resources across branches. From the Amplify console, go to your **App overview** page, select **Build settings** under the **Hosting** for viewing your app's build specification YAML file.

Update the build settings for the `backend` phase to run `npx ampx generate outputs --branch dev app-id $AWS_APP_ID` to generate the `amplify_outputs.json` file for all branches other than `main` or `dev`. After this update, any new deployed branches will not deploy backend resources as part of the build and instead will use the deployed backend resources from the `dev` branch.
