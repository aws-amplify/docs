Amplify Studio's **File browser** provides a view of the backend file storage for an application. You can use this feature to test your files and to provide both technical and non-technical team members with the ability to create and update an application's files in real-time instead of building admin views.

By default, your storage is created with the following 4 folders:

- **private/** - Files here are nested under the user whom owns the file. Only the file owner can access or edit the files.
- **protected/** - Files here are nested under the user whom owns the file. These files are accessible by all users, but editable only by the file owner.
- **public/** - Files in here are accessible by all users of your app.
- **upload/** - Contains files that were uploaded by users. Only the bucket owner has access to these files.
