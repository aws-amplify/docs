Amplify CLI version 7 and above has been updated to give developers the ability to override Amplify-generated IAM, Cognito, and S3 configuration to best meet app requirements. With the new override capability, developers can easily configure their backend with Amplify-provided defaults but still customize fine-grained resource settings.

The new overrides capabilities or any future resource changes modifies the file structures of your Amplify project under the hood. Projects created before Amplify CLI version 7 require a migration. It is recommended to test this migration in a non-production environment first, without any updates to the app:

1. `amplify add env test`
2. `amplify override <api|auth|project|storage>` or `amplify update <api|auth|project|storage>`
3. Answer "y" to migrate your resources
4. `amplify push`
5. Test your app scenarios now with this test environment

Once verified, switch to your original environment `amplify env checkout <env-name>` and apply the override migration by either running `amplify override <category>` or `amplify update <category>`.
