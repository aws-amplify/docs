The Amplify CLI provides GraphQL directives to enhance your schema with additional capabilities such as custom indexes, authorization rules, function triggers, and more.

| Directive | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@model`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/) | Defines top level object types in your API that are backed by Amazon DynamoDB |
| [`@primaryKey`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#configure-a-primary-key) | Configures custom primary key for @model types |
| [`@index`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#configure-a-secondary-index) | Configures custom secondary index structures for @model types |
| [`@auth`](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-auth/) | Defines authorization rules for your @model types and fields |
| [`@hasOne`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#has-one-relationship) | Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models. For example, a Project "has one" Team. This allows you to query the team from the project record |
| [`@hasMany`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#has-many-relationship) | Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models. For example, a Post has many comments. This allows you to query all the comments from the post record |
| [`@belongsTo`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#belongs-to-relationship) | Use a "belongs to" relationship to make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional. For example, a Project has one Team and a Team belongs to a Project. This allows you to query the team from the project record and vice versa |
| [`@manyToMany`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#many-to-many-relationship) | Configures a "join table" between two models to facilitate a many-to-many relationship. For example, a Blog has many Tags and a Tag has many Blogs |
| [`@function`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/custom-business-logic/#lambda-function-resolver) | Configures a Lambda function resolvers for a field |
| [`@http`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/custom-business-logic/#http-resolver) | Configures an HTTP resolver for a field |
| [`@predictions`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/connect-machine-learning-services/) | Queries an orchestration of AI/ML services such as Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Translate, and/or Amazon Polly |
| [`@searchable`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/search-and-result-aggregations/) | Makes your data searchable by streaming it to Amazon OpenSearch |
| [`@mapsTo`](/[platform]/tools/cli/graphqlapi/schema-evolution/) | Once a table contains production data that cannot be deleted, `@mapsTo` can be used to specify the original name |  |
