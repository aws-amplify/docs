<Accordion title="Understanding Auth high-level concepts" eyebrow="Learn more">

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

- _Authentication_ is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as _AuthN_). The system which does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
- _Authorization_ is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as _AuthZ_). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include:

- Username/password which is simple to set up but prone to compromise.
- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties.

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by:

- Adding password policies that ensure stronger passwords are created by your users.
- Require additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Add multi-factor authentication which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.
