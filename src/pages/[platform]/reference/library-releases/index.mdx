## The JavaScript library versioning

Amplify JS follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for releases. This specification for version numbers imparts meaning to the underlying code changes between versions and the potential impact when you perform an update.

- **Major version release:** contains significant new features, necessary breaking changes to support new features, or changes to supported peer dependencies versions. Updating to the latest major version is almost always recommended, however you may need to follow Amplify JS migration guides to integrate new changes into existing projects and discover new APIs.
- **Minor version release:** contains new small, additive features. A minor version is backwards-compatible; you are not required to make any changes in your projects to update to a newer minor version.
- **Patch version release:** contains bug fixes.

## Version support

### Support policy

- **Active:** receives regular bug fixes, new additive features, security patches.
