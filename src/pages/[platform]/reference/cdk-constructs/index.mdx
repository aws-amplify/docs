Constructs—the basic building blocks of [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) apps—abstract away the complexity of configuring cloud resources, so you can concentrate on your application code. In the following sections, we summarize the available Amplify backend constructs.

## Amplify Data

The official `AmplifyData` construct can be found on [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/@aws-amplify/data-construct/?lang=typescript).

<Callout>
This package provides a Level 3 (L3) CDK construct wrapping the behavior of the Amplify GraphQL API. This enables quick development and iteration of AppSync APIs that support the Amplify GraphQL directives.

## Amplify Auth (alpha)

The official `AmplifyAuth` construct is currently in alpha and is not yet suitable for production use in your CDK applications. It can be found on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/auth-construct-alpha).
