## Branch deployments

Branch deployments require the [`AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess) managed policy to be able to deploy backend resources during a fullstack deployment. When connecting your project through the console, a role with this policy attached will be automatically created for you.

## Cloud sandbox deployments

Sandbox deployments, by design, use local credentials to deploy resources. You need to ensure that the local profile has the `AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess` policy attached to it.
