**Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2?**

We are still actively developing migration tooling to aid in transitioning your project from Gen 1 to Gen 2. Until then, we recommend you continue working with your Gen 1 Amplify project. We’ve put together a Gen 1 vs. Gen 2 feature support matrix [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/migrate-to-gen2/). We remain committed to supporting both Gen 1 and Gen 2 for the foreseeable future. For new projects, we recommend adopting Gen 2 to take advantage of its enhanced capabilities. Meanwhile, customers on Gen 1 will continue to receive support for high-priority bugs and essential security updates.

**If I have a Gen 1 app, can I use Gen 2 in it?**

Amplify Gen 1 and Gen 2 follow different architectural and tooling paradigms, which was necessary to address common customer feedback from Gen 1. You will need to use our upcoming migration tooling to move from a Gen 1 to Gen 2 app. You cannot use Amplify Gen 1 (Studio/CLI) in the same app as Gen 2.

**Should I use Amplify Gen 1 or Gen 2 in new apps?**

If you're building a new app, we recommend you use Amplify Gen 2.

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support DataStore?**

Amplify Gen 2 supports GraphQL APIs without DataStore. We will release migration support for moving DataStore Gen 1 apps to Gen 2.

**What programming languages does Amplify Gen 2 support?**

Amplify Gen 2 supports a wide range of programming languages for client-side development. This includes dedicated client-side libraries for JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Java, Kotlin, and Swift. For backend development, Amplify Gen 2 uses TypeScript.

**In Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications (for example, Authentication, Analytics, API, DataStore, Geo, and Predictions). Are those same categories available in Gen 2?**

Amplify Gen 2 offers built-in support for Auth, Data, Storage, and Functions. Other use cases can be implemented in Amplify Gen 2 as well using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs which there is documentation for under the respective category name.

**Can I use Gen 2 with a JavaScript frontend that doesn't use TypeScript?**

Yes. Amplify Gen 2's TypeScript backend definition works with JavaScript frontends. In addition, you still get an end-to-end typed data fetching experience even with a pure JavaScript frontend. See [Generate a Data client](/react/build-a-backend/data/connect-to-API/#generate-the-amplify-data-client) for the recommended JavaScript client code.

**What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to our application in Gen 2?**

Because Amplify builds on the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), any AWS services supported by the CDK can be added to your app using [custom resources](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/custom-resources/) and L2/L1 AWS CDK constructs.

**What happens once my application grows too big and I want to do more configuration with my application (add more features, other AWS services, etc.)?**

You can stay with Amplify no matter how big your application grows. Amplify is layered on top of the AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation. These provide a standardized way of interacting with AWS, so you can add any [AWS service supported by CDK to your Amplify app](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/custom-resources/). You can also override [Amplify-generated configuration of your resources](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/overriding-resources/) using the CDK. You can use any deployment pipeline you choose if you want more control over your CI.

**How much does it cost to operate Amplify Gen2?**

You can read all about Amplify's pricing on our [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/pricing/).

**Which Amplify JavaScript version is compatible with Gen 2?**

Amplify JavaScript version 6.2.0 and above is compatible with backends created by Amplify Gen 2.

{/* **Can I use any other database storage other than Amazon DynamoDB? Does it have to be noSQL?**

You can also use an [existing MySQL or PostgreSQL database](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/connect-api-to-existing-database/) in an Amplify app. With Gen 2's [custom query and mutation support](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/custom-business-logic), you can integrate with any existing data source through a Lambda function as well. */}
