**Is Gen 2 backward compatible with existing Amplify projects on Gen 1?**

No, Gen 2 is not backward compatible with existing Amplify projects on Gen 1. Amplify Gen 1 and Gen 2 follow different architectural and tooling paradigms in order for Gen 2 to address common feedback customers had about Gen 1. The two versions are not compatible.

**Is there a way to upgrade an existing Amplify project from Gen 1 to Gen 2?**

We are working on supporting migrations from Gen 1 to Gen 2. In the meantime, Gen 1 is still fully supported and you can continue to use it in apps you've already created.

**Should I use Amplify Gen 1 or Gen 2 in new apps?**

If you're building a new app, we recommend you use Amplify Gen 2.

**Does Amplify Gen 2 support DataStore?**

Amplify code-first DX (Gen 2) supports GraphQL APIs without DataStore. We will release migration support for moving DataStore Gen 1 apps to Gen 2.

**What programming languages does Amplify Gen 2 support?**

Amplify Gen 2 supports a wide range of programming languages for client-side development. This includes dedicated client-side libraries for JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, Java, Kotlin, and Swift. For backend development, Amplify Gen 2 uses TypeScript.

**In Gen 1, Amplify offered a set of use case categories for building applications (for example, Authentication, Analytics, API, DataStore, Geo, and Predictions). Are those same categories available in Gen 2?**

Amplify code-first DX (Gen 2) supports Auth, Data, Storage, and Functions. Other use cases can be implemented using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) constructs which there is documentation for under the respective category name.

**What if we want to add a feature like AI/ML or Amazon Location Service to our application in Gen 2?**

Because Amplify builds on the AWS CDK, any of the 175+ AWS services can be added to your app using [custom resources](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/custom-resources/) and L2/L1 AWS CDK constructs.
