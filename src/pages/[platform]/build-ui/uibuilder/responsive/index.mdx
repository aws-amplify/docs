You can use Amplify Studio to dynamically toggle between different component variants based on your app's breakpoint. For example, you can have the navigation bar shrink to a smaller size as the window gets smaller.

## 1. Set your preferred breakpoints in Figma

To apply breakpoints to components generated by Amplify Studio, you must have a Figma account with the [AWS Amplify Theme Editor](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1040722185526429545/AWS-Amplify-Theme-Editor) plugin installed.

By default, all Amplify UI provides the following [breakpoints as part of the Amplify UI theme](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/theming/responsive#breakpoints):


```
{
  base: '0',
  small: '480px',
  medium: '768px',
  large: '992px',
  xl: '1280px',
  xxl: '1536px',
}
```

Breakpoints are set at the [Amplify UI Theme](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/theming/responsive) level, which means they apply to all components in your Figma file. You can customize these breakpoints using the Amplify Theme Editor plugin:

1. Right click in your Figma project and select <strong>Plugins</strong> > <strong>AWS Amplify Theme Editor</strong>
![Context menu showing how to view plugins and select the AWS Amplify Theme Editor](/images/studio/responsive/theme-editor.png)

2. Select the <strong>Breakpoints</strong> tab and click on any breakpoint to customize the pixel value
![AWS Amplify Theme Editor with the Breakpoints tab selected](/images/studio/responsive/breakpoints.png)

The grey bar within the outlined box will indicate your pixel value compared to a 1920px-wide display.

## 2. Configure your Figma variants

To make a component responsive, create different variants for the component based on the breakpoints. [Learn more about creating variants in Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061175334-Create-interactive-components-with-variants).

<Callout warning>

**IMPORTANT:** The variants are required to have the same <strong>component structure</strong>. Elements within the component structure must also use the same <strong>layout method</strong> (i.e. "Auto Layout" or manual).
<br />
If the variants don't have the same structure, then Amplify Studio will not be able to import the component.
<br />
To customize child elements in variants, you can use the eye icon to hide and show elements in different variants.

![Image showing that the component structure needs to be the same](/images/studio/responsive/component-structure2.png)

</Callout>

When generating a component with variants in Figma, a Property will be created and assigned to each variant. Make the following configurations to your component:
1. Change the component property name to `breakpoint`
2. For each variant, set `breakpoint`'s value to one of the supported values (e.g. `small`, `xl`, etc)

## 3. Render and test your component

With your design complete in Figma, import and render your component using Amplify Studio UI Builder:
1. [Sync your Figma file with UI Builder](/[platform]/build-ui/uibuilder/responsive/)
2. In your local project, run `amplify pull`
3. Import and render your new React component in code
4. Resize the window - your component will change automatically based on the breakpoints you set before

>Note: rendering responsive components requires the Amplify CLI version 3.1.1 or higher. To check your CLI version, run `amplify -v` and to upgrade, run `amplify upgrade`

## Advanced: Configure responsive components with existing variants

Figma allows users to create variants based on multiple properties.  For example, a component may need `breakpoint` variants (small, medium, and large) and `displayMode` variants (light mode, dark mode).

If your component has any variant properties in addition to `breakpoint`, additional steps are required for responsiveness.  All additional properties <i>must</i> be given inline values, or the component will not be responsive.

In the below examples, the `ResponsiveToolbar` component has both `breakpoint` and `displayMode` variants.  In the following example, the component will **not** automatically be responsive.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ResponsiveToolbar />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

To make this component responsive, `displaymode` must be given a value. In the following example, the component will now automatically be responsive.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ResponsiveToolbar displaymode='light' />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

Alternatively, multidimensional variants can be separated into separate components, each with only the `breakpoint` variant property.  For example, the above component could be split into `ResponsiveToolbarLight` and `ResponsiveToolbarDark`, and rendered conditionally. In the following example, the component will now automatically be responsive.

```jsx
function App() {
  let darkMode = false
  return (
    <div>
      {!darkMode ? <ResponsiveToolbarLight/> : <ResponsiveToolbarDark/>}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
