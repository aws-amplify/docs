Amplify migration tooling is available! In this guide we will walk through how to perform migrations for your backends from Amplify Gen 1 to Amplify Gen 2. The steps you will perform will be against a new Amplify Gen 1 backend environment, and a new Amplify Gen 2 environment. After the steps are performed, you will be able to merge the migration branch onto your existing branches to individually migrate with zero downtime.

The migration tooling supports all major categories of Amplify Gen 2:

- Auth
- Data (previously API > GraphQL API)
- Storage
- Functions

Please note not all resource configuration properties are supported, however the migration tooling will generate code with errors signaling where manual intervention is required.

## Preparing for migration

The most notable change between Amplify Gen 1 backends and Gen 2 backends is the use of infrastructure as code with TypeScript. Preparing your environment for migration involves converting the configuration of your live Gen 1 backend resources to their Gen 2 equivalent written using TypeScript.

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

Prerequisites: 

- Node.js v18.17.1 or higher
- [Local AWS CLI profile](/gen1/[platform]/start/getting-started/installation/) with `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` and the `AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess` policies attached.
- Existing Gen 1 backend or a [new Gen 1 app created](/gen1/[platform]/start/getting-started/) with some backend resources.
- Git
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)

</Callout>

To get started, create a new git branch and Amplify backend:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git checkout --branch migrate
```

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
amplify add env migrate
```

<Callout info>

**Note:** at any moment up until the migration is executed on your Gen 1 and Gen 2 backends, you can revert by discarding changes tracked by git.

</Callout>

<Callout info>

**Testers Only** 

For testing purposes, you will need to additionally install the tagged versions of the `@aws-amplify/cli` package.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install @aws-amplify/cli@12.15.0-next-3.0
```

</Callout>

Then push your newly-created `migrate` environment to create a set of resources matching the configuration of your live environments:

<Callout info>

**Testers Only** 

If you have API resources, you will need to enable the following feature flag in your `amplify/cli.json` file:

```json title="amplify/cli.json" showLineNumbers={false}
{
  "features": {
    "graphqltransformer": {
       "enablegen2migration": true
     }
  }
}
```
</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
amplify push --yes
```

Next, make a note of the stack name of your Gen 1 migrate backend, this should be in your `amplify/team-provider-info.json` file.

```json title="amplify/team-provider-info.json" showLineNumbers={false}
{
  "migrate": {
    "awscloudformation": {
      //... other fields
      "StackName": "amplify-your-app-migrate-1234567890",
    }
  }
}
```

After the push is successful, commit and push the changes to your git provider:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git add .
git commit -m "create migration env"
git push --upstream origin migrate
```

During the migration for the new `migrate` environment, it is recommended to connect the new git branch to your build system to ensure changes continuously integrate with your live environment.

Next, prepare your local codebase for migration execution by running the following command:

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

If you are using a names AWS CLI profile other than `default`, you will need to set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the name of the profile.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
```

then run the following command to prepare your local codebase for migration execution:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-4.0 to-gen-2 prepare
```

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@latest to-gen-2 prepare
```

After this command completes successfully your `amplify/` directory is converted to an Amplify Gen 2 backend authored in TypeScript. In the next section we will walk through how to validate the generated code using [Amplify Gen 2's sandbox feature](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/sandbox-environments/setup/).


## Validating the preparation

The preparation command will add npm dependencies relevant to your Gen 2 backend in the root `package.json`. Before you begin with the validation, install dependencies:


```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install
```

<Callout info>

**Testers Only** 

For testing purposes, you will need to additionally install the tagged versions of the `@aws-amplify/backend` and `@aws-amplify/backend-data` packages.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install @aws-amplify/backend@0.0.0-test-20250307211308 @aws-amplify/backend-data@0.0.0-test-20250307211308
```

</Callout>

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

**Auth**

We will need to add the following manually to `backend.ts` file to set up the `Identity providers` on the `User pool client`. This is needed since Gen 2 only supports 1 user pool client out-of-the-box. Add the following code to `backend.ts` file after the `User pool client` is defined:

```typescript
const providerSetupResult = (backend.auth.stack.node.children.find(child => child.node.id === 'amplifyAuth') as any).providerSetupResult;
for (const provider in providerSetupResult) {
    const providerSetupPropertyValue = providerSetupResult[provider];
    if (providerSetupPropertyValue.node && providerSetupPropertyValue.node.id.endsWith('IDP')) {
        userPoolClient.node.addDependency(providerSetupPropertyValue);
    }
}
```

**Data**

If you have GraphQL API, you would need to manually input your schema in `data/resource.ts` file.

```typescript
import { defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
export const data = defineData({
  migratedAmplifyGen1DynamoDbTableMap: [
    {
      branchName: "sandbox",
      modelTableNameMap: {
        Post: "Post-xnibcobqircidcckd2zx2uzxgq-dev",
        Comment: "Comment-xnibcobqircidcckd2zx2uzxgq-dev",
      },
    },
  ],
  schema: `
// Copy your Gen 1 schema here
  `,
});
```

</Callout>


{/* how to handle the thrown errors in the code */}
{/* porting custom resolvers, overridden resolvers */}
{/* porting custom resources themselves */}

<Callout info>

In order to provide a smoother experience with the migration tooling, we have added `throw new Error` messages to the generated code. This is to ensure that resources requiring manual changes are modified in your sandbox environment before the migration is executed.

For example, if you have a Node.js Lambda function in Gen 1, you will see the following error in your sandbox run:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false} 
Source code for this function can be found in your Amplify Gen 1 Directory. See .amplify/migration/amplify/backend/function/app81ff331aPostConfirmation/src
```

you will need to copy the code from your Gen 1 backend and make any necessary changes to the code such as updating to TypeScript and updating the import statements. 

**Note:** You will need to install the Lambda dependencies in the project root `package.json` file.

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox
```

<Callout info>

If you have not deployed a Amplify Gen 2 backend before, the process will redirect you the Amplify Console to bootstrap your AWS account and region. Ensure you are signed in with Admin credentials.

If you experience any errors, refer to the [troubleshooting section]([platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/).

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox delete --yes
```

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git push
```

## Deploying your temporary migration branch

In order to execute the migration you will need to first deploy the Amplify Gen 2 backend, scaffolded by the TypeScript code generated by the preparation command. This will create a new CloudFormation stack with live resources, which will then be used to execute the migration against to migrate resources from your Amplify Gen 1 backend stack to the new stack.

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

Deploy a new Amplify App with your repository and select the `migrate` branch.

<Video src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/deploy.mp4" description="Video - Deploy the starter app" />

</Callout>

1. Create a [environment variable](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/fullstack-branching/secrets-and-vars/#set-environment-variables) `AMPLIFY_GEN_1_ENV_NAME` with the name of your Gen 1 environment as the value.

2. Next, make a note of the stack name of your Gen 2 backend, you can find this in the build logs or the CloudFormation stack console:
    - Open the [CloudFormation stack console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
    - Find the stack with the Amplify AppID. The name should be in the format `amplify-<app-id>-<branch-name>-<random-id>`
    - Make a note of the stack name.

### Ensure validity of `amplify.yml`

{/* maybe move this section up before deploying the branch -- otherwise it will likely error for frontend builds */}
{/* ensure package manager is correct */}
{/* tweak frontend build settings */}

## Executing migration

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-4.0 to-gen-2 execute \
  --from <amplify-gen-1-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-2-stack-name>
```

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@latest to-gen-2 execute \
  --from <amplify-gen-1-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-2-stack-name>
```

## Reverting the migration

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-4.0 to-gen-2 revert \
  --from <amplify-gen-2-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-1-stack-name>
```

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@latest to-gen-2 revert \
  --from <amplify-gen-2-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-1-stack-name>
```

Then copy the `amplify/` directory from the `.amplify/migration` directory back into your project.


## Post-migration tasks

{/* a note about s3 bucket names */}
{/* ... anything else */}
{/* set up CI/CD */}
{/* deploy using backend-cli manually (for those not using Amplify to deploy today) */}

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

Delete Cognito User pool custom domain from `amplify/backend.ts` as the domain already exists (This will not delete the domain from Cognito User pool):

```typescript
delete (backend.auth.stack.node.children.find(child => child.node.id === 'amplifyAuth') as any).domainPrefix;
```

Open `.amplify/migration/README.md` and follow the instructions to complete the post-migration tasks.

Then redeploy the application by committing the changes to Git.

</Callout>

## Verify continuous deployment

After performing the post-migration tasks, commit your changes and allow your deployment pipeline to deploy changes without error.
