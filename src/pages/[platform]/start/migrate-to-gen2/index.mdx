Amplify migration tooling is available! In this guide we will walk through how to perform migrations for your backends from Amplify Gen 1 to Amplify Gen 2. The steps you will perform will be against a new Amplify Gen 1 backend environment, and a new Amplify Gen 2 environment. After the steps are performed, you will be able to merge the migration branch onto your existing branches to individually migrate with zero downtime.

The migration tooling supports all major categories of Amplify Gen 2:

- Auth
- Data (previously API > GraphQL API)
- Storage
- Functions

Please note [not all resource categories or configuration properties are supported](#unsupported-categories), however the migration tooling will generate code with errors signaling where manual intervention is required.

## Preparing for migration

The most notable change between Amplify Gen 1 backends and Gen 2 backends is the use of infrastructure as code with TypeScript. Preparing your environment for migration involves converting the configuration of your live Gen 1 backend resources to their Gen 2 equivalent written using TypeScript.

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

Prerequisites:

- Node.js v18.19.x or higher
- [Local AWS CLI profile](/gen1/[platform]/start/getting-started/installation/) with `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` and the `AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess` policies attached.
- Existing Gen 1 backend or a [new Gen 1 app created](/gen1/[platform]/start/getting-started/) with some backend resources.
- Git
- Package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm)

</Callout>

To get started, create a new git branch and Amplify backend:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git checkout --branch migrate
```

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
amplify add env migrate
```

<Callout info>

**Note:** at any moment up until the migration is executed on your Gen 1 and Gen 2 backends, you can revert by discarding changes tracked by git.

</Callout>

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

For testing purposes, you will need to additionally install the tagged versions of the `@aws-amplify/cli` package.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install @aws-amplify/cli@12.15.0-next-3.0
```

</Callout>

In your `amplify/cli.json` file, enable the feature flag to prepare your GraphQL API's resources for migration.

```json title="amplify/cli.json" showLineNumbers={false}
{
  // ...
  "features": {
    "graphqltransformer": {
       "enablegen2migration": true
     }
  }
}
```

Then push your newly-created `migrate` environment to create a set of resources matching the configuration of your live environments:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
amplify push
```

Next, make a note of the stack name of your Gen 1 migrate backend, this should be in your `amplify/team-provider-info.json` file.

```json title="amplify/team-provider-info.json" showLineNumbers={false}
{
  "migrate": {
    "awscloudformation": {
      //... other fields
      "StackName": "amplify-your-app-migrate-1234567890",
    }
  }
}
```

After the push is successful, commit and push the changes to your git provider:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git add .
git commit -m "create migration env"
git push --upstream origin migrate
```

During the migration for the new `migrate` environment, it is recommended to connect the new git branch to your build system to ensure changes continuously integrate with your live environment.

Next, prepare your local codebase for migration execution by running the following command:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-11.0 to-gen-2 prepare
```

After this command completes successfully your `amplify/` directory is converted to an Amplify Gen 2 backend authored in TypeScript. In the next section we will walk through how to validate the generated code using [Amplify Gen 2's sandbox feature](/[platform]/deploy-and-host/sandbox-environments/setup/).

## Unsupported Categories

Some resource categories from Amplify Gen 1 are not supported in Amplify Gen 2. The migration preparation will add errors to your generated backend TypeScript code where manual intervention is required. For example,

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
throw new Error("Geo category is not supported and must be ported to CDK manually. Follow the guide https://docs.amplify.aws/react/migrate-to-gen2#unsupported-categories")
```

### Analytics

Analytics resources were created using the AWS SDK in Amplify Gen 1. For Gen 2 backends we recommend using CDK to reference the existing Pinpoint applications:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { CfnApplication } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-pinpoint"

// reference the existing resource
const analytics = CfnApplication.fromArn("...")

// add resource information to the outputs file
backend.addOutputs({
  custom: {
    analytics: {
      id: "..."
    }
  }
})
```

Then configure the Amplify client library to use the reference from the "custom" section of your outputs file:

```ts title="src/amplify.ts"
import { Amplify } from "aws-amplify"
import outputs from "../amplify_outputs.json"

Amplify.configure({
  Analytics: {
    id: outputs.custom.analytics.id,
  }
})
```

### Custom

{/* a note about how custom resources are ported for you but you must create the resource map */}
{/* sample snippets and resource map example */}

### Geo

Amplify Gen 2 does not have a native Geo integration, however you can migrate your existing Geo resources by porting the configuration into CDK. To learn more about creating Geo resources with CDK, visit the [set up guide for Geo](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/geo/set-up-geo/).

After porting the resource configuration you must include the Geo resources in the [resource map](#executing-migration).

{/* sample json of resource map for geo */}

### Notifications

Amplify Gen 2 does not have a native Notifications integration, however you can migrate your Notifications resources by porting the configuration into CDK. To learn more about creating Notifications resources with CDK, visit the [set up guide for In-App Messaging](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/in-app-messaging/set-up-in-app-messaging/).

After porting the resource configuration you must include the Geo resources in the [resource map](#executing-migration).

{/* sample json of resource map for Notifications */}

### REST APIs

Amplify Gen 2 leverages AWS AppSync's GraphQL API for its data layer. REST APIs created with Amplify Gen 1 must be recreated using CDK. To learn more about creating REST APIs in Amplify Gen 2, visit the [REST API guides](/[platform]/build-a-backend/add-aws-services/rest-api/)

## Validating the preparation

The preparation command will add npm dependencies relevant to your Gen 2 backend in the root `package.json`. Before you begin with the validation, install dependencies:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install
```

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

For testing purposes, you will need to additionally install the tagged versions of the `@aws-amplify/backend` and `@aws-amplify/backend-data` packages.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm install @aws-amplify/backend@0.0.0-test-20250416182614 @aws-amplify/backend-data@0.0.0-test-20250416182614
```

</Callout>

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

**Data**

If you have GraphQL API and would like to test the tables in sandbox environment, you would need to set the `branchName` to `sandbox` in `data/resource.ts` file. 

Note: on a branch deploy, the `branchName` should be the name of the Gen 2 branch you created in the previous steps when deploying.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { defineData } from "@aws-amplify/backend";
const schema = `
input AMPLIFY {
  globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public }
} # FOR TESTING ONLY!
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
  `;
export const data = defineData({
  migratedAmplifyGen1DynamoDbTableMappings: [
    {
      branchName: "sandbox", // Set the branch name to sandbox for testing in sandbox environment
      modelNameToTableNameMapping: {
        Todo: "Todo-xnibcobqircidcckd2zx2uzxgq-dev",
      },
    },
  ],
  schema
});
```
</Callout>


{/* how to handle the thrown errors in the code */}
{/* porting custom resolvers, overridden resolvers */}
{/* porting custom resources themselves */}

<Callout info>

In order to provide a smoother experience with the migration tooling, we have added `throw new Error` messages to the generated code. This is to ensure that resources requiring manual changes are modified in your sandbox environment before the migration is executed.

For example, if you have a Node.js Lambda function in Gen 1, you will see the following error in your sandbox run:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
Source code for this function can be found in your Amplify Gen 1 Directory. See .amplify/migration/amplify/backend/function/app81ff331aPostConfirmation/src
```

you will need to copy the code from your Gen 1 backend and make any necessary changes to the code such as updating to TypeScript and updating the import statements.

**Note:** You will need to install the Lambda dependencies in the project root `package.json` file.

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox
```

<Callout info>

If you have not deployed a Amplify Gen 2 backend before, the process will redirect you the Amplify Console to bootstrap your AWS account and region. Ensure you are signed in with Admin credentials.

If you experience any errors, refer to the [troubleshooting section]([platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/).

</Callout>

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx ampx sandbox delete --yes
```

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git push
```

## Deploying your temporary migration branch

In order to execute the migration you will need to first deploy the Amplify Gen 2 backend, scaffolded by the TypeScript code generated by the preparation command. This will create a new CloudFormation stack with live resources, which will then be used to execute the migration against to migrate resources from your Amplify Gen 1 backend stack to the new stack.

<Video src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/deploy.mp4" description="Video - Deploy the starter app" />

Next, make a note of the stack name of your Gen 2 backend, you can find this in the build logs or the CloudFormation console:
  1. Open the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
  2. Find the stack with the Amplify AppID. The name should be in the format `amplify-<app-id>-<branch-name>-<random-id>`
  3. Make a note of the stack name.

{/* how to handle CDK bootstrap */}
{/* how to handle updating service role BEFORE AND AFTER migrations */}

### Ensure validity of `amplify.yml`

{/* maybe move this section up before deploying the branch -- otherwise it will likely error for frontend builds */}
{/* ensure package manager is correct */}
{/* tweak frontend build settings */}

## Executing migration

The migration tooling orchestrates [AWS CloudFormation stack refactor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stack-refactoring.html) operations on your behalf. However, if your Gen 1 backend environment contains custom resources or makes use of categories such as Geo, REST APIs, you will need to create a mapping of resources from both CloudFormation stacks to extend the stack refactor operation.

```json title="my-map.json"
{
  "": {}
}
```

{/* resource map */}

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-11.0 to-gen-2 execute \
  --from <amplify-gen-1-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-2-stack-name> \
  --resource-map my-map.json
```

## Post-migration tasks

{/* a note about s3 bucket names */}
{/* ... anything else */}
{/* set up CI/CD */}
{/* deploy using backend-cli manually (for those not using Amplify to deploy today) */}

<Callout info>

**Testers Only**

Delete Cognito User pool custom domain from `amplify/backend.ts` as the domain already exists (This will not delete the domain from Cognito User pool):

```typescript
delete (backend.auth.stack.node.children.find(child => child.node.id === 'amplifyAuth') as any).domainPrefix;
```

Open `.amplify/migration/README.md` and follow the instructions to complete the post-migration tasks.

Then redeploy the application by committing the changes to Git.

</Callout>

## Reverting the migration

If you need to revert the migration/stack refactor operation, you can use the `revert` command to revert the migration from your Gen 2 stack to your Gen 1 stack.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-11.0 to-gen-2 revert \
  --from <amplify-gen-2-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-1-stack-name>
```

When using a resource map for custom resources or resource categories from Gen 1, you can pass a resource mapping to this command.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx @aws-amplify/migrate@0.1.0-next-11.0 to-gen-2 revert \
  --from <amplify-gen-2-stack-name> \
  --to <amplify-gen-1-stack-name> \
  --resource-map my-map.json
```

Then copy the `amplify/` directory from the `.amplify/migration` directory back into your project.

## Verify continuous deployment

After performing the post-migration tasks, commit your changes and allow your deployment pipeline to deploy changes without error.
