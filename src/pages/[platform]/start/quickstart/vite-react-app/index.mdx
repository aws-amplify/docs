👋 Welcome to AWS Amplify! In this quickstart guide, you will:
1. deploy a React + Vite app
2. build and connect to a database
3. configure authentication and authorization rules


## Deploy a React app to AWS Amplify

To get started faster, we've created a starter "To-do" application. First, clone this starter application into your GitHub account.

<ExternalLinkButton
  size="large"
  href='https://github.com/new?template_name=gen2-starter&template_owner=renebrandel&name=gen2-starter&description=My%20Amplify%20Gen%202%20starter%20application'
>
<IconGithub />
Use starter template
</ExternalLinkButton>

Next, go to the AWS Amplify console to deploy the application.

<ExternalLinkButton
  size="large"
  href='https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/create/repo-branch'
>
<IconAmplify />
Deploy starter template
</ExternalLinkButton>

Select **Start with an existing app** > **GitHub**, pick the starter repository, and hit "Deploy".

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/deploy.mp4" />
</video>

While you wait for the build (~5 min), let's take a tour on the key files included in the starter repository:

```text
├── amplify/ # Folder containing your Amplify backend configuration
│   ├── auth/ # Definition for your auth backend
│   │   └── resource.ts
│   ├── data/ # Definition for your data backend
│   │   └── resource.ts
|   ├── backend.ts
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── src/ # React UI code
│   ├── App.tsx # UI code to sync todos in real-time
│   ├── index.css # Styling for your app
│   └── main.tsx # Entrypoint where the Amplify client library is configured
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Once the build has completed view the newly deployed app by selecting "View production URL".

  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/hosted-app.mp4" />
</video>

## Build and connect to a database

The starter application already has pre-written code to give you a real-time feed of all todos and the ability to add new todos. Let's learn how to enhance the functionality with delete operations.

First, clone your repository locally by following instructions on your GitHub repo page:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git clone https://github.com/<github-user>/gen2-starter.git
```

Next, install all dependencies in order to run the dev environment locally.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
cd gen2-starter
npm install
```

### Generate client configuration file for deployed environments

Every app that uses the Amplify Backend needs a client configuration file **amplifyconfiguration.json**, which contains backend endpoint information, publicly-viewable API keys, authentication flow information, and more. The Amplify client library uses this client configuration file to connect to your Amplify Backend.

First, find your application id in the Amplify console under **App Settings** > **General Settings** > **App ARN**. Select **ONLY** the portion after the final "/".

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/select-app-id.mp4" />
</video>

Next, run the following command in your Terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <YOUR_APP_ID> --branch main
```

A new **amplifyconfiguration.json** file should appear in your repository's root directory. Review how the configuration file is imported within the `main.tsx` file and passed into the `Amplify.configure(...)` function of the Amplify client library.


### Add "delete todo" functionality

Go to the **src/App.tsx** file and add in a new `deleteTodo` functionality and pass function into the `<li>` element's `onClick` handler.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
function App() {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  function deleteTodo(id: string) {
    client.models.Todo.delete({ id })
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>My todos</h1>
      <button onClick={createTodo}>+ new</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => <li
          // highlight-next-line
          onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}
          key={todo.id}>
          {todo.content}
        </li>)}
      </ul> 
      <div>
        🥳 App successfully hosted. Try creating a new todo.
        <br />
        <a href="">Review next step of this tutorial.</a>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Try out the deletion functionality now by starting the local dev server:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm run dev
```

This should start a local dev server at http://localhost:5173.


<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-delete.mp4" />
</video>

Once everything works, push your latest changes to the Amplify-hosted URL by committing everything to git and push.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added delete functionality"
git push -u origin/main
```

Amplify automatically deploys the latest version of your app based on your git commits. In just a few minutes, when the application rebuilds, the hosted URL will be updated to support the deletion functionality.

## Add authentication

The starter application already has a pre-configured auth backend defined in the **amplify/auth/resource.ts** file. We've configured it to support email and password login but you can extend it to support a variety of login mechanisms, including Google, Amazon, Sign In With Apple, and Facebook.

The fastest way to get your login experience up and running is to use our Authenticator UI component. In your **src/App.tsx** file, import the Authenticator UI component and wrap your `<main>` element.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// highlight-start
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css'
// highlight-end
// ... other imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <Authenticator>
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
    // highlight-end
        <main>
          {/*...*/}
          // highlight-next-line
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </main>
      )}
    // highlight-next-line
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

The Authenticator component auto-detects your auth backend settings and renders the correct UI state based on the auth backend's authentication flow.

Try out your application in your localhost environment again. You should be presented with a login experience now.


<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added authenticator"
git push
```


## Setup cloud sandbox for rapid fullstack iteration

In the prior steps, we were working against our production-grade databases and authentication backend but **what if you want to work against an isolated backend environment purely used for development purposes?**

Amplify's cloud sandbox functionality creates a per-developer backend environment intended for your localhost development and testing workflows. This allows you to test and iterate without touching production backend data. 


<Callout info>

**First time using AWS Amplify Gen 2 on your computer?** [Configure your AWS account to grant Amplify permissions locally](/[platform]/start/account-setup/). **Note:** If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your local machine, and you have configured the corresponding AWS profile with the **AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess** permission policy, you can skip this step.

</Callout>


To start your cloud sandbox, run the following command in a **new Terminal window**:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox
```

Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed (~5 min), you'll see the **amplifyconfiguration.json** file updated with connection information to a new isolated authentication and data backend.

<Callout info>

The `npx amplify sandbox` command should run concurrently to your `npm run dev`. You can think of the cloud sandbox as the "localhost-equivalent for your app backend".

</Callout>

## Configure authorization rules for your app data

The todos in the starter are currently shared across all users but in most cases you want data to be isolated on a per-user basis. 

To isolate the data on a per-user basis, you can use "owner-based authorization rule". Let's apply the owner-based authorization rule to your todos:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string(),
    // highlight-next-line
  }).authorization([a.allow.owner()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // This tells the data client in your app (generateClient())
    // to sign API requests with the user authentication token. 
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'userPool',
  },
});
```

In the application client code, let's also render the username to distinguish different users once they're logged in. Go to your **src/App.tsx** file and render the `user` property.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ... imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      // highlight-next-line
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
        <main>
          // highlight-next-line
          <h1>{user?.signInDetails?.loginId}'s todos</h1>
          {/* ... rest of the UI */}
        </main>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

Now, let's go back to your localhost application and test out the user isolation of the todos. 

You will need to sign up new users again because now you're working with the cloud sandbox instead of your production backend.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added per-user data isolation"
git push
```

Once your build completes in Amplify Hosting, the production backend will update to support the changes made within the cloud sandbox. The data in the cloud sandbox is fully isolated and won't pollute your production database.
