ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AWS Amplify! In this quickstart guide, you will:

1. Deploy a React and Vite app
2. Build and connect to a database with real-time data updates
3. Configure authentication and authorization rules

## Deploy a fullstack app to AWS

We've created a starter "To-do" application to help get started faster. First, you will create a repository in your GitHub account using our starter React template.

### 1. Create the repository

Use our starter template to create a repository in your GitHub account. This template scaffolds `create-vite-app` with Amplify backend capabilities.

<ExternalLinkButton
  size="medium"
  href='https://github.com/new?template_name=amplify-vite-react-template&template_owner=aws-samples&name=amplify-vite-react-template&description=My%20Amplify%20Gen%202%20starter%20application'
>
<IconGithub />
Create repository from template
</ExternalLinkButton>

Use the form in GitHub to finalize your repo's creation.

### 2. Deploy the starter app

Now that the repository has been created, deploy it with Amplify.

<ExternalLinkButton
  size="medium"
  variation="primary"
  href='https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/create/repo-branch'
>
<IconAmplify />
Deploy to AWS
</ExternalLinkButton>

{/* QQ: this should be Host a web app -> Next -> if a pop up from GitHub, allow - repository branch -> then use the default on the "app settings" page -> click next -> save and deploy*/}

Select **Start with an existing app** > **GitHub**, pick the starter repository, and hit "Deploy".

  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/deploy.mp4" />
</video>

### 3: View deployed app

<Accordion title='Learn about the project structure' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='While you are waiting for your app to deploy (~5 mins)'>

{/* QQ: should this be before "View deployed app" and also should you clone this locally first? Or are they browsing on GitHub? */}

Let's take a tour of the project structure in this starter repository. The starter application has pre-written code for a to-do list app. It gives you a real-time database with a feed of all to-do list items and the ability to add new items. 

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ amplify/ # Folder containing your Amplify backend configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ # Definition for your auth backend
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resource.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Definition for your data backend
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resource.ts
|   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # React UI code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx # UI code to sync todos in real-time
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css # Styling for your app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tsx # Entrypoint of the Amplify client library
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```
</Accordion>

{/* want to highlight any files to look at especially? Talk through any of the code? */}

 When the build completes, visit the newly deployed branch by selecting "View deployed URL". Since the build deployed an API, database, and authentication backend, you will be able to create new to-do items.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/hosted-app.mp4" />
</video>

In the Amplify Console, navigate to the Data manager to see the data entered in your database.

## Make frontend updates

Let's learn how to enhance the app functionality by creating a delete flow for to-do list items. 

### 4. Set up local environment

Click on your deployed branch and you will land on the **Deployments** page which shows you your build history and a list of deployed backend resources.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/branch-details.mp4" />
</video>

At the bottom of the page you will see a tab for **Deployed backend resources**. Click on the tab and then click the **Download outputs file** button. 

![outputs](/images/gen2/getting-started/react/amplify-outputs-download.png)

{/* I think this step should happen when the user is on GitHub -> they probably need to go back to that tab to get the repo url that makes it so they have to switch one fewer time. */}

Clone the repository locally.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git clone https://github.com/<github-user>/amplify-vite-react-template.git
cd amplify-vite-react-template && npm install
```

{/* this file means the amplify-output.json file? */}

Now move the `amplify-output.json` file you downloaded above to the root of your project.

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ amplify
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”œâ”€â”€ amplify-outputs.json <== backend outputs file
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

<Accordion title='amplify-outputs.json' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>
The **amplify-outputs.json** file contains backend endpoint information, publicly-viewable API keys, authentication flow information, and more. The Amplify client library uses this outputs file to connect to your Amplify Backend.  You can review how the outputs file is imported within the `main.tsx` file and then passed into the `Amplify.configure(...)` function of the Amplify client library. 
</Accordion>



### 5. Implement delete functionality

Go to the **src/App.tsx** file and add in a new `deleteTodo` functionality and pass function into the `<li>` element's `onClick` handler.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
function App() {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  function deleteTodo(id: string) {
    client.models.Todo.delete({ id })
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>My todos</h1>
      <button onClick={createTodo}>+ new</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => <li
          // highlight-next-line
          onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}
          key={todo.id}>
          {todo.content}
        </li>)}
      </ul> 
      <div>
        ðŸ¥³ App successfully hosted. Try creating a new todo.
        <br />
        <a href="">Review next step of this tutorial.</a>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Try out the deletion functionality now by starting the local dev server:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm run dev
```

This should start a local dev server at http://localhost:5173.

  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-delete.mp4" />
</video>



### 6. Implement login UI

{/* we alternate between .ts and .tsx files in this tutorial - think they should all be .tsx */}

The starter application already has a pre-configured auth backend defined in the **amplify/auth/resource.ts** file. We've configured it to support email and password login but you can extend it to support a variety of login mechanisms, including Google, Amazon, Sign In With Apple, and Facebook.

The fastest way to get your login experience up and running is to use our Authenticator UI component. In your **src/App.tsx** file, import the Authenticator UI component and wrap your `<main>` element.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// highlight-start
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css'
// highlight-end
// ... other imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <Authenticator>
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
    // highlight-end
        <main>
          {/*...*/}
          // highlight-next-line
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </main>
      )}
    // highlight-next-line
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

The Authenticator component auto-detects your auth backend settings and renders the correct UI state based on the auth backend's authentication flow.

Try out your application in your localhost environment again. You should be presented with a login experience now.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added authenticator"
git push
```

Amplify automatically deploys the latest version of your app based on your git commits. In just a few minutes, when the application rebuilds, the hosted app will be updated to support the deletion functionality.

## Make backend updates

Let's update our backend to implement per-user authorization rules, allowing each user to only access their own to-dos.

### 7. Set up local AWS credentials

To make backend updates, we are going to require AWS credentials to deploy backend updates from our local machine. 

**Skip ahead to step 8**, if you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your local machine, and your AWS profile has the `AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess` permission policy.

Otherwise, **[set up local AWS credentials](/[platform]/start/account-setup/)** that grant Amplify permissions to deploy backend updates from your local machine.


### 8. Deploy cloud sandbox

To update your backend without affecting the production branch, use Amplify's cloud sandbox. This feature provides a separate backend environment for each developer on a team, ideal for local development and testing.

To start your cloud sandbox, run the following command in a **new Terminal window**:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox
```

Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed (~5 min), you'll see the `amplify-outputs.json` file updated with connection information to a new isolated authentication and data backend.

<Callout info>

The `npx amplify sandbox` command should run concurrently to your `npm run dev`. You can think of the cloud sandbox as the "localhost-equivalent for your app backend".

</Callout>

### 9. Implement per-user authorization

The to-do items in the starter are currently shared across all users, but, in most cases, you want data to be isolated on a per-user basis. 

To isolate the data on a per-user basis, you can use an "owner-based authorization rule". Let's apply the owner-based authorization rule to your to-do items:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string(),
    // highlight-next-line
  }).authorization([a.allow.owner()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // This tells the data client in your app (generateClient())
    // to sign API requests with the user authentication token. 
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'userPool',
  },
});
```

In the application client code, let's also render the username to distinguish different users once they're logged in. Go to your **src/App.tsx** file and render the `user` property.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ... imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      // highlight-next-line
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
        <main>
          // highlight-next-line
          <h1>{user?.signInDetails?.loginId}'s todos</h1>
          {/* ... rest of the UI */}
        </main>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

Now, let's go back to your local application and test out the user isolation of the to-do items. 

You will need to sign up new users again because now you're working with the cloud sandbox instead of your production backend.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added per-user data isolation"
git push
```

Once your build completes in the Amplify Console, the `main` backend will update to support the changes made within the cloud sandbox. The data in the cloud sandbox is fully isolated and won't pollute your production database.
