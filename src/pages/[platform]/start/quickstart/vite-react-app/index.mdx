ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AWS Amplify! In this quickstart guide, you will:
1. deploy a React + Vite app
2. build and connect to a database
3. configure authentication and authorization rules


## Step 1: Deploy a Fullstack React app to AWS Amplify

To get started faster, we've created a starter "To-do" application. First, create a repository in your GitHub account using our starter React template.

### 1a: Create repository from a starter template
<ExternalLinkButton
  size="medium"
  href='https://github.com/new?template_name=gen2-starter&template_owner=renebrandel&name=gen2-starter&description=My%20Amplify%20Gen%202%20starter%20application'
>
<IconGithub />
Create repository from template
</ExternalLinkButton>

### 1b: Deploy starter to Amplify

<ExternalLinkButton
  size="medium"
  href='https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/create/repo-branch'
>
<IconAmplify />
Deploy to Amplify
</ExternalLinkButton>

Select **Start with an existing app** > **GitHub**, pick the starter repository, and hit "Deploy".

</video>

### 1c: Clone repo locally

While you wait for the build (~6 min), let's take a tour of the starter repository. First, clone the repository locally: 

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git clone https://github.com/<github-user>/gen2-starter.git
```

Now open the project in an IDE of your choice, and let's tour the files. The starter application already has pre-written code to give you a real-time database with a feed of all todos and the ability to add new todos. 

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ amplify/ # Folder containing your Amplify backend configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/ # Definition for your auth backend
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resource.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Definition for your data backend
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ resource.ts
|   â”œâ”€â”€ backend.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ # React UI code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx # UI code to sync todos in real-time
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.css # Styling for your app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tsx # Entrypoint where the Amplify client library is configured
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Now head back to the console. When the build completes, visit the newly deployed branch by selecting "View production URL". Because the build deployed an API, database, and authentication backend, you will be able to create new todos.

</video>

## Step 2: Add Delete To-do functionality

Let's learn how to enhance the functionality with delete operations. 

### 2a: Connect to the deployed branch database

Navigate to the cloned repository and install all dependencies in order to run the dev environment locally.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
cd gen2-starter
npm install
```

Next, run the following command in your Terminal:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify generate config --app-id <your-app-id> --branch main
```
<Callout info>

**First time using AWS Amplify Gen 2 on your computer?** [Configure your AWS account to grant Amplify permissions locally](/[platform]/start/account-setup/). **Note:** If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your local machine, and you have configured the corresponding AWS profile with the **AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess** permission policy, you can skip this step.

</Callout>

First, find your application id in the Amplify console under **App Settings** > **General Settings** > **App ARN**. Select **ONLY** the portion after the final "/".

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/select-app-id.mp4" />
</video>

A new **amplifyconfiguration.json** file should appear in your repository's root directory. Every app that uses the Amplify Backend needs a client configuration file **amplifyconfiguration.json**, which contains backend endpoint information, publicly-viewable API keys, authentication flow information, and more. The Amplify client library uses this client configuration file to connect to your Amplify Backend.  Review how the configuration file is imported within the `main.tsx` file and passed into the `Amplify.configure(...)` function of the Amplify client library. 

### 2b: Write UI code to implement "delete to-do"

Go to the **src/App.tsx** file and add in a new `deleteTodo` functionality and pass function into the `<li>` element's `onClick` handler.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
function App() {
  // ...
  // highlight-start
  function deleteTodo(id: string) {
    client.models.Todo.delete({ id })
  }
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>My todos</h1>
      <button onClick={createTodo}>+ new</button>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => <li
          // highlight-next-line
          onClick={() => deleteTodo(todo.id)}
          key={todo.id}>
          {todo.content}
        </li>)}
      </ul> 
      <div>
        ðŸ¥³ App successfully hosted. Try creating a new todo.
        <br />
        <a href="">Review next step of this tutorial.</a>
      </div>
    </main>
  )
}
```

Try out the deletion functionality now by starting the local dev server:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm run dev
```

This should start a local dev server at http://localhost:5173.

</video>



## Step 3: Add login UI

The starter application already has a pre-configured auth backend defined in the **amplify/auth/resource.ts** file. We've configured it to support email and password login but you can extend it to support a variety of login mechanisms, including Google, Amazon, Sign In With Apple, and Facebook.

The fastest way to get your login experience up and running is to use our Authenticator UI component. In your **src/App.tsx** file, import the Authenticator UI component and wrap your `<main>` element.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// highlight-start
import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react'
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css'
// highlight-end
// ... other imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <Authenticator>
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
    // highlight-end
        <main>
          {/*...*/}
          // highlight-next-line
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </main>
      )}
    // highlight-next-line
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

The Authenticator component auto-detects your auth backend settings and renders the correct UI state based on the auth backend's authentication flow.

Try out your application in your localhost environment again. You should be presented with a login experience now.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} width="100%" playsInline={true}>
  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added authenticator"
git push
```

## Step 4: Commit code to git

Once everything works, push your latest changes to the Amplify-hosted URL by committing everything to git and push.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added delete functionality"
git push -u origin main
```

Amplify automatically deploys the latest version of your app based on your git commits. In just a few minutes, when the application rebuilds, the hosted URL will be updated to support the deletion functionality.

## Step 5: Make backend updates

### 5a: Deploy cloud sandbox environment

In the prior steps, we were working against our production `main` branch's databases and authentication backend but **what if you want to update your backend without impacting your production branch?**

Amplify's cloud sandbox functionality creates a per-developer backend environment intended for your localhost development and testing workflows. This allows you to test and iterate without touching production backend data. 

To start your cloud sandbox, run the following command in a **new Terminal window**:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox
```

Once the cloud sandbox has been fully deployed (~5 min), you'll see the **amplifyconfiguration.json** file updated with connection information to a new isolated authentication and data backend.

<Callout info>

The `npx amplify sandbox` command should run concurrently to your `npm run dev`. You can think of the cloud sandbox as the "localhost-equivalent for your app backend".

</Callout>

### 5b: Update authorization rules for your app data

The todos in the starter are currently shared across all users but in most cases you want data to be isolated on a per-user basis. 

To isolate the data on a per-user basis, you can use "owner-based authorization rule". Let's apply the owner-based authorization rule to your todos:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string(),
    // highlight-next-line
  }).authorization([a.allow.owner()]),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // This tells the data client in your app (generateClient())
    // to sign API requests with the user authentication token. 
    // highlight-next-line
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'userPool',
  },
});
```

In the application client code, let's also render the username to distinguish different users once they're logged in. Go to your **src/App.tsx** file and render the `user` property.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
// ... imports

function App() {
  // ...
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      // highlight-next-line
      {({ signOut, user }) => (
        <main>
          // highlight-next-line
          <h1>{user?.signInDetails?.loginId}'s todos</h1>
          {/* ... rest of the UI */}
        </main>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  )
}
```

Now, let's go back to your localhost application and test out the user isolation of the todos. 

You will need to sign up new users again because now you're working with the cloud sandbox instead of your production backend.

  <source src="/images/gen2/getting-started/react/demo-auth.mp4" />
</video>

To get these changes to the cloud, commit them to git and push the changes upstream.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
git commit -am "added per-user data isolation"
git push
```

Once your build completes in Amplify Hosting, the production backend will update to support the changes made within the cloud sandbox. The data in the cloud sandbox is fully isolated and won't pollute your production database.
