Create a new Vanilla JavaScript app with vite using the following commands, create the directory (`amplify-js-app`) and files for the app.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
✔ Project name: amplify-js-app
✔ Select a framework: › Vanilla
✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
```

Initialize npm and install dependencies and dev dependencies.

```bash
cd amplify-js-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build. You can see the running app by navigating to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Add the following to the `index.html` file:

```html

## Create a new React App

To get started, first create a new React app, and then install and use the Amplify CLI to start adding backend capabilities to your app.

From your projects directory, run the following command and respond the prompts:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
✔ Project name: react-amplified
✔ Select a framework: › React
✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
```

This creates a new React app in a directory called **react-amplified**. You can then run the following commands to switch into the new **react-amplified** directory, install the project dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
cd react-amplified
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build. You can see the running app by navigating to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

<InlineFilter filters={['angular']}>

Use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (your preferred stylesheet provider)

This tutorial is built using the pages directory from NextJS. To learn more about using Amplify with the NextJS app directory please visit this [documentation page](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/server-side-rendering//#use-amplify-with-nextjs-app-router-app-directory).

</Callout>

To set up the project, you'll first create a new Next.js app with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app), a simple CLI tool that enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

From your projects directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest next-amplified --no-app
cd next-amplified
```

You'll need to select if you'd like to build this project with TypeScript (Yes) or JavaScript (No), and then if you'd like ESLint to be configured as well. Note that if you select Typescript, there may be additional changes you'll need to make throughout this guide to files and configurations.

Once these have been selected, a new Next.js app will be created in a directory called `next-amplified` and then switches us into that new directory.

Now that you're in the root of the project, you can run the app by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows us to see the output generated by the build, you can see the running app by navigating to \http://localhost:3000>.

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

Create a new app with the following command:

```sh
npx create-expo-app amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Start the app with the following command:

For Android:

```sh
npx expo run:android
```

For iOS:

```sh
npx expo run:ios
```

Follow the additional prompts to configure your build and allow it some time to process. When ready, you app should launch in the respective simulator.

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

After you [setup development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), create a new app with the following command:

```bash
npx react-native init amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```console
r - reload the app
d - open developer menu
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
```

Use the Vue Vite powered `create-app` to bootstrap a new Vue 3 app (selecting the defaults will work for this project):

```bash
npm init vue@3

Need to install the following packages:
  create-vue@3
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Project name: … vue-amplified

✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? … No
✔ Add Cypress for both Unit and End-to-End testing? … No
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No
```

This creates a new Vue app in a directory called vue-amplified. You can then run the following commands to switch into the new vue-amplified directory, install the project dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
cd vue-amplified
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Initialize a new backend

Now that you have a running app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app.

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add cloud capabilities, such as GraphQL API and web hosting. As you add these features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify JavaScript client library is able to get the necessary information to connect to your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- An Amplify project is created for you that can be accessed within the AWS Console by running `amplify console`. The AWS Amplify console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, deployment statuses, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources.

## Install Amplify Libraries

<InlineFilter filters={['react','javascript','nextjs','vue','angular']}>

The `aws-amplify` package is the main library for working with Amplify Libraries in your projects:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>
Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

<Block name="Expo CLI">

```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

```sh
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/react-native @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

You will also need to install the pod dependencies for iOS:

```sh
npx pod-install

## Set up frontend

Next, configure Amplify so it can interact with backend services.

<InlineFilter filters={['react','javascript','angular','nextjs','vue']}>

    <InlineFilter filters={['react']}>
        Open **src/main.jsx** and add the following code below the last import:

        Open **src/main.js** and add the following code below the last import:
    </InlineFilter>

    ```javascript
    import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
    import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';
    Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
    ```

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

```javascript
// App.js

import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './src/amplifyconfiguration.json';
Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

```javascript
// index.js

import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './src/amplifyconfiguration.json';
Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

</InlineFilter>

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in **amplifyconfiguration.json** will update automatically.

Now that your app is set up and Amplify is initialized, you can add an API in the next step.
