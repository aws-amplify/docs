Create a new Vanilla JavaScript app with vite using the following commands, create the directory (`amplify-js-app`) and files for the app.

```bash
npm create vite@latest
✔ Project name: amplify-js-app
✔ Select a framework: › Vanilla
✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
```

Initialize npm and install dependencies and dev dependencies.

```bash
cd amplify-js-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build. You can see the running app by navigating to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Create a new React App

To get started, first create a new React app, and then install and use the Amplify CLI to start adding backend capabilities to your app.

From your projects directory, run the following command and respond the prompts:

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="TypeScript">

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ✔ Project name: react-amplified
    ✔ Select a framework: › React
    ✔ Select a variant: › TypeScript
    ```

  </Block>
  <Block name="JavaScript">

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest
    ✔ Project name: react-amplified
    ✔ Select a framework: › React
    ✔ Select a variant: › JavaScript
    ```

  </Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

This creates a new React app in a directory called **react-amplified**. You can then run the following commands to switch into the new **react-amplified** directory, install the project dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
cd react-amplified
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build. You can see the running app by navigating to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

<InlineFilter filters={['angular']}>

Use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev/tools/cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash

```

```console
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS
? Do you want to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Pre-rendering)? No
```

This is create your angular app in a folder `amplify-app`. Use the following command to switch into that folder:

```bash
cd amplify-app
```

<InlineFilter filters={['nextjs']}>

<Callout>

This tutorial is built using the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).

</Callout>

To set up the project, you'll first create a new Next.js app with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app), a simple CLI tool that enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you. You'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

From your projects directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm create next-app@14 -- next-amplified --ts --no-eslint --src-dir --import-alias '@/*' --no-tailwind --app
cd next-amplified
```

This command will bootstrap the project with the following options:

- App Router
- TypeScript
- No ESLint
- With the `src` directory
- No Tailwind CSS
- imports aliased to `@/` (the default)

Now that you're in the root of the project, you can run the app by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows us to see the output generated by the build, you can see the running app by navigating to \http://localhost:3000>.

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

<Callout>

Amplify now requires native modules not available through the Expo SDK. As a result, Expo Go is no longer supported but you should still be able to use Expo. [Learn more about dropping support for Expo Go in Amplify v6](/react-native/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/migrate-from-javascript-v5-to-v6/#dropping-support-for-expo-go).

</Callout>

Create a new app with the following command:

```sh
npx create-expo-app amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Start the app with the following command:

For Android:

```sh
npx expo run:android
```

For iOS:

```sh
npx expo run:ios
```

Follow the additional prompts to configure your build and allow it some time to process. When ready, you app should launch in the respective simulator.

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

After you [setup development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), create a new app with the following command:

```bash
npx react-native init amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```console
r - reload the app
d - open developer menu
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
```

✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? … No
✔ Add Cypress for both Unit and End-to-End testing? … No
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No
```

This creates a new Vue app in a directory called vue-amplified. You can then run the following commands to switch into the new vue-amplified directory, install the project dependencies, and run the app:

```bash
cd vue-amplified
npm install
npm run dev

## Initialize a new backend

Now that you have a running app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app.

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

Your backend needs a project name to use when creating resources. Give your backend project the name `todo`

```console

You'll then be asked to accept some recommended values:

```
The following configuration will be applied:

```

> Where possible the CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in. In this case it knew you are using Vue and provided the proper configuration for type of app, framework, source, distribution, build, and start options.

Next, you will need to select the authentication method you want to use to work on your project locally:

```
? Select the authentication method you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
> AWS profile
  AWS access keys
```

Select AWS profile and then choose the profile you configured in the [Prerequisites](/[platform]/start/getting-started/installation/).

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add cloud capabilities, such as GraphQL API and web hosting. As you add these features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` in your designated **Source Directory Path** that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify JavaScript client library is able to get the necessary information to connect to your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list

## Install Amplify Libraries

```sh
npx pod-install

After installing pod dependencies, rebuild the app:

```sh
npm run ios
```

</Block>

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in **amplifyconfiguration.json** will update automatically.
