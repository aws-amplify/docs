Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14.4 or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later

**Note:** Although AWS Amplify only requires node v14.x or later, this tutorial uses features available in Angular v17 which require minimum node v18.13.

This tutorial assumes that you're familiar with both JavaScript/ES6 and React. If you need to brush up on React, we recommend going through the [official tutorial](https://react.dev/learn).

- Initialize a new React Native application. There are two ways to do this:

1. Expo CLI - Easier for new React Native developers
2. React Native CLI - If you are already familiar with mobile development, enables you to build native code into your project.

This tutorial will cover both, so use what's best for you.

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial.

[Create AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)

> There are no upfront charges or any term commitments to create an AWS account and signing up gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier.

## Install the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

  <Block name="npm">

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

  </Block>

  <Block name="cURL (Mac and Linux)">

```bash
curl -sL https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/install | bash && $SHELL
```

## Configure the Amplify CLI

To set up the Amplify CLI on your local machine, you have to configure it to connect to your AWS account.

<Callout info>

**Note**: If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your machine, you can skip this step.

</Callout>

Configure Amplify by running the following command:

```bash
amplify configure
```

<Callout info>

The `configure` command only supports creating AWS profiles that use permanent credentials. If you are using an IAM role or IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO), [learn how to configure Amplify CLI manually](#manually-configure-the-amplify-cli)

</Callout>

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.

Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to use the [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) to create an IAM user. 

```console
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Follow the instructions at
https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#configure-the-amplify-cli

to complete the user creation in the AWS console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create
```

Navigate to the [IAM User creation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create) if it's not already open.

Enter a User name and select **Next**. You can name the user anything but we'll call it "amplify-dev".

![First step of creating an IAM user. Specifying user details.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-name.png)

Select **Attach policies directly** and select **AdministratorAccess-Amplify** as the Permissions policy. Select **Next**.

![Second step of creating an IAM user. Setting permissions.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-permissions.png)

On the Review page, check that everything looks good and select **Create user**.

![Third and final step of creating an IAM user. Reviewing and creating.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-review.png)

This will redirect to the users list page. Select the user you just created.

![New user being shown in the Users table.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-list.png)

On the user details page, navigate to the **Security credentials** tab, scroll down to **Access keys** and select **Create access keys**.

![Security credentials tab of the newly created user.](/images/cli/user-creation/create-access-keys.png)

On the next page, select **Command Line Interface**, acknowledge the warning, and select **Next**.

![Command Line Interface option selected on the options list.](/images/cli/user-creation/ack-page.png)

On the next page select **Create access key**. You'll then see a page with the access keys for the user. Use the copy icon to copy these values to your clipboard, then return to the Amplify CLI.

![Retrieve access keys page with access key and secret access key copy buttons circled.](/images/cli/user-creation/access-keys-done.png)

Enter the values you just copied into the corresponding CLI prompts.

```console
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

On the next page, you'll set up the app and initialize Amplify.

## Manually configure the Amplify CLI

If you are using an IAM role or IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO), you can configure your local machine for use with Amplify CLI by creating [AWS profile entries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-format-profile) manually rather than the `amplify configure` wizard.

To create an AWS profile locally using IAM Identity Center, you can use the AWS CLI wizard, [`aws configure sso`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso), or write to `~/.aws/config` directly:

<Callout info>

[Learn how to install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

</Callout>

```toml title="~/.aws/config"
[profile my-sso-profile]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess-Amplify
region = us-west-2
output = json

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

Currently, the Amplify CLI requires a workaround for use with IAM Identity Center due to [an issue in how it resolves credentials](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/4488).

```diff title="~/.aws/config"
[profile my-sso-profile]
sso_session = my-sso
sso_account_id = 123456789011
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess-Amplify
region = us-west-2
output = json
+ credential_process = aws configure export-credentials --profile my-sso-profile

[sso-session my-sso]
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access
```

Using the example above, when creating a new app or pulling an existing app, specify `my-sso-profile` as the AWS profile you'd like to use with the Amplify app.

To create [an AWS profile locally using an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html), assign the `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` permissions set to the role and set the role in your `~/.aws/config` file:

```toml title="~/.aws/config"
[profile amplify-admin]
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/amplify-admin
source_profile = amplify-user

[profile amplify-user]
region=us-east-1
```

Using the example above, when creating a new app or pulling an existing app, specify `amplify-admin` as the AWS profile you'd like to use with the Amplify app
