- Initialize a new React Native application. There are two ways to do this:

1. Expo CLI - Easier for new React Native developers
2. React Native CLI - If you are already familiar with mobile development, enables you to build native code into your project.

This tutorial will cover both, so use what's best for you.

## Sign up for an AWS account

If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial.

[Create AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)

> There are no upfront charges or any term commitments to create an AWS account and signing up gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier.

## Install the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

## Configure the Amplify CLI

To set up the Amplify CLI on your local machine, you have to configure it to connect to your AWS account.

> If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your machine, you can skip this step.

Configure Amplify by running the following command:

```bash
amplify configure
```

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.

Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user.

> Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. You can learn more about Amazon IAM [here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

```console
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Follow the instructions at
https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#configure-the-amplify-cli

to complete the user creation in the AWS console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create
```

Navigate to the [IAM User creation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create) if it's not already open.

Enter a User name and select **Next**. You can name the user anything but we'll call it "amplify-dev".

![First step of creating an IAM user. Specifying user details.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-name.png)

Select **Attach policies directly** and select **AdministratorAccess-Amplify** as the Permissions policy. Select **Next**.

![Second step of creating an IAM user. Setting permissions.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-permissions.png)

On the Review page, check that everything looks good and select **Create user**.

![Third and final step of creating an IAM user. Reviewing and creating.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-review.png)

This will redirect to the users list page. Select the user you just created.

![New user being shown in the Users table.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-list.png)

On the user details page, navigate to the **Security credentials** tab, scroll down to **Access keys** and select **Create access keys**.

![Security credentials tab of the newly created user.](/images/cli/user-creation/create-access-keys.png)

On the next page, select **Command Line Interface**, acknowledge the warning, and select **Next**.

![Command Line Interface option selected on the options list.](/images/cli/user-creation/ack-page.png)

On the next page select **Create access key**. Youâ€™ll then see a page with the access keys for the user. Use the copy icon to copy these values to your clipboard, then return to the Amplify CLI.

![Retrieve access keys page with access key and secret access key copy buttons circled.](/images/cli/user-creation/access-keys-done.png)

Enter the values you just copied into the corresponding CLI prompts.

```console
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

In the next section, you'll set up the app and initialize Amplify.
