```

## Practical example: Building a fullstack app

Here's an example of how you might use AWS MCP Server to build a complete Amplify application. This demonstrates how the pre-built workflows guide your AI assistant through each step.

### Step 1: Set up the backend

Start by describing your application to your AI assistant:

```
I want to build a task management app. Users should be able to:
- Sign up and sign in with email
- Create, edit, and delete their own tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- See their tasks in real-time across devices
```

Your AI assistant uses the **Backend Implementation workflow** to:
1. Configure authentication with email sign-in
2. Create a Task data model with proper authorization rules
3. Set up real-time subscriptions for task updates

### Step 2: Connect the frontend

Next, ask your assistant to connect your frontend:

```
Connect my React app to the backend. I want a sign-in page and a 
dashboard that shows the user's tasks.
```

Your AI assistant uses the **Frontend Integration workflow** to:
1. Install and configure Amplify libraries
2. Set up the Authenticator component
3. Create data fetching hooks for tasks
4. Implement real-time updates in the UI

### Step 3: Deploy the application

Finally, deploy your application:

```
Set up deployment so the app deploys automatically when I push to GitHub.
Configure preview deployments for pull requests.
```

Your AI assistant uses the **Deployment Guide workflow** to:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Amplify Hosting
2. Configure branch-based deployments
3. Set up pull request previews
4. Configure production environment settings

## Tips for effective prompts

To get the best results from AWS MCP Server, keep these tips in mind:

<Callout info>

**Be specific about your requirements.** Instead of "add authentication," try "add authentication with email sign-in, Google social login, and MFA."

</Callout>

- **Describe the user experience** you want, not just the technical implementation
- **Mention your framework** so the workflow can provide framework-specific guidance
- **Ask follow-up questions** if you need clarification on any step
- **Request explanations** if you want to understand why certain patterns are recommended

## Next steps

Now that you understand the pre-built workflows, try using them in your next Amplify project:
