Follow the [AWS MCP Server setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mcp/latest/userguide/getting-started-aws-mcp-server.html) to configure AWS MCP Server with your AI coding assistant. The guide covers:

- Installing prerequisites (AWS CLI, uv package manager)
- Configuring your MCP client (Amazon Kiro, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and others)
- Setting up AWS credentials and IAM permissions
- Testing your connection

## Amplify-specific setup tips

Once you have AWS MCP Server configured, here are some tips for Amplify development:

### AWS credentials for Amplify

If you haven't set up AWS credentials for Amplify development yet, follow the [Configure AWS for local development](/[platform]/start/account-setup/) guide. This ensures you have the right permissions for both AWS MCP Server and Amplify CLI operations.

### IAM permissions

The base AWS MCP Server permissions allow your AI assistant to access the guided workflows and documentation. For Amplify development, your credentials also need permissions to create and manage Amplify resources.

If you're using the `AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess` managed policy for Amplify development, you likely have sufficient permissions. If you encounter permission errors, check with your AWS administrator.

### Verify Amplify workflows are available

After setup, verify that the Amplify workflows are accessible by asking your AI assistant:

```
Which guided workflows are available for Amplify development?
```

Your assistant should describe the Backend Implementation, Frontend Integration, and Deployment Guide workflows.

## Next steps

Now that you have AWS MCP Server configured, learn about the [guided workflows](/[platform]/start/mcp-server/amplify-workflows/) available to accelerate your Amplify development.
