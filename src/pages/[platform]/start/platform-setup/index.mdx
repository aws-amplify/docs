## iOS

Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 13.0 and Xcode 15.0 or higher when targeting iOS. Follow the steps below to update the minimum deployment target.

Open `ios/Podfile` and update the target iOS platform to 13.0 or higher.

<Callout info>
If there is no file located at `ios/Podfile`, add `amplify_flutter` to your `pubspec.yaml` and run `pub get`. This will automatically create the file.
</Callout>

```diff title="ios/Podfile"
- # Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
- # platform :ios, '12.0'
+ platform :ios, '13.0'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the iOS version to 13.0 or higher.

## Android

Amplify Flutter supports API level 24+ (Android 7.0+), and requires Gradle 8+, Kotlin 1.9+, and Java 17+ when targeting Android. Follow the steps below to apply these changes in your app. 

<Callout warning>
The steps below are intended for Flutter apps created with Flutter version 3.16+. If your app was created prior to version 3.16, please follow the guide [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/flutter-gradle-plugin-apply) to migrate to Gradle's declarative plugins block before following the steps below.
</Callout>

1. Open `android/settings.gradle` and update the Android Gradle plugin and kotlin versions:

```diff title="android/settings.gradle"
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
-   id "com.android.application" version "7.3.0" apply false
-   id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.7.10" apply false
+   id "com.android.application" version "8.1.0" apply false
+   id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.9.10" apply false
}
```

2. Open `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` and update the Gradle `distributionUrl`.

```diff title="android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties"
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
zipStoreBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
zipStorePath=wrapper/dists
-distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0-all.zip
+distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.0-all.zip
```

3. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and update the Java version and minimum Android SDK version.

```diff title="android/app/build.gradle"
android {
    namespace = "com.example.myapp"
    compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion = flutter.ndkVersion
    compileOptions {
-       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
-       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
+       sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
+       targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    }

    defaultConfig {
        // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
        applicationId = "com.example.myapp"
        // You can update the following values to match your application needs.
        // For more information, see: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#reviewing-the-gradle-build-configuration.
-       minSdk = flutter.minSdkVersion
+       minSdk = 24
        targetSdk = flutter.targetSdkVersion
        versionCode = flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName = flutterVersionName
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
            // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
            signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug
        }
    }
}
```

<Callout info>
If you would like to use a higher version of Gradle or Android Gradle plugin see the compatibility matrix [here](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle).
</Callout>

### Network Permissions for Release Builds

Flutter apps have access to make network requests by default in debug mode. This permission needs to be added when building in release mode. To do this, open `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and make the following addition.

```xml title="android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml"
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
// highlight-start
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
// highlight-end
...
</manifest>
```

## Web

There are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions when targeting web. You will need to use a browser supported by Flutter. See the following Flutter docs for more info:

- [Supported deployment platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms)
- [FAQ: Which web browsers are supported by Flutter?](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/faq#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-flutter)

## macOS

Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 10.15 and Xcode 15.0 or higher when targeting macOS. Additionally, you will need to enable networking, keychain entitlements, and code signing.

### Update Minimum Version

Open `macos/Podfile` and update the target macOS platform to 10.15 or higher.

<Callout info>
If there is no file located at `macos/Podfile`, add `amplify_flutter` to your `pubspec.yaml` and run `pub get`. This will automatically create the file.
</Callout>

```diff title="ios/Podfile"
- platform :osx, '10.14'
+ platform :osx, '10.15'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the macOS version to 10.15 or higher.

![Setting the macOS version to 10.15 or higher in the Minimum Deployments tab of the Runner general section.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/target-min-deployment-version.png)

Select Runner, Project -> Runner and then the "Info" tab. Update "macOS Deployment Target" to 10.15 or higher.

![Setting the macOS version to 10.15 or higher in the macOS Deployment Target tab of the Runner info section.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/project-min-deployment-version.png)

### Enable Network Calls

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "Signing and Capabilities" tab. Under "App Sandbox" select "Outgoing Connections (Client)".

![Selecting outgoing connections in the app sandbox section of the runner signing and capabilities tab.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/xcode-entitlements.png)

For more info on the Networking entitlement, see Apple's documentation on [com.apple.security.network.client](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client).

### Enable Keychain Sharing

<Callout info>

This capability is required because Amplify uses the Data Protection Keychain on macOS as a platform best practice. 
See [TN3137: macOS keychain APIs and implementations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3137-on-mac-keychains)
for more information on how Keychain works on macOS and the Keychain Sharing entitlement.

</Callout>

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "Signing and Capabilities" tab.

1. Click the "+ icon".

![Plus icon circled in the signing and capabilities section of the runner tab.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/enable-keychain-access.png)

2. Search for "Keychain Sharing" in the subsequent modal, and add it.

![Keychain Sharing search result after searching keychain.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/search-keychain-sharing.png)

3. Scroll down to "Keychain Sharing" in the "Signing and Capabilities" and click the "+" icon. By default, your bundle ID will be used.

![Plus icon highlighted in the keychain sharing section of the signing and capabilities section of runner.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/adding-keychain-access-group.png)

4. Finally, add a development team and enable signing.

![Team selector and Enable Development Signing button highlighted in the signing and capabilities section of the runner tab.](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/enable-signing.png)


## Windows

There are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions when targeting Windows. You will need to use a Windows version supported by Flutter. See the following Flutter docs for more info:

- [Supported deployment platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms)

## Linux

Amplify Flutter depends on the [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) library when targeting Linux.

### Local Development

To run and debug an app that depends on Amplify Flutter, you must install `libsecret-1-dev`. Run the following commands to install `libsecret-1-dev`. this will also install dependencies of `libsecret-1-dev`, such as `libglib2.0-dev`.

<Callout info>
  The command below is intended for Ubuntu. The command may vary on other Linux distributions.
</Callout>

{/* cSpell:disable */}

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev
```

{/* cSpell:enable */}

### Packaging Your App

To include the required dependencies when packaging your app with Snapcraft, include them in your `snapcraft.yaml` file. For more info, see [Flutter's documentation on releasing to the Snap Store](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux).

```yaml
parts:
  my-app:
    plugin: flutter
    source: .
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-0
```
