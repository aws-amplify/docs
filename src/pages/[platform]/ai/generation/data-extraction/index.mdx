Data extraction allows you to parse unstructured text and extract structured data using AI. This is useful for converting free-form text into typed objects that can be used in your application.

The following example shows how to extract product details from an unstructured product description. The AI model will analyze the text and return a structured object containing the product name, summary, price, and category.

```typescript title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
const schema = a.schema({
  ProductDetails: a.customType({
    name: a.string().required(),
    summary: a.string().required(),
    price: a.float().required(),
    category: a.string().required(),
  }),

  extractProductDetails: a.generation({
    aiModel: a.ai.model('Claude 3.5 Haiku'),
    systemPrompt: 'Extract the property details from the text provided',
  })
    .arguments({
      productDescription: a.string()
    })
    .returns(a.ref('ProductDetails'))
    .authorization((allow) => allow.authenticated()),
});
```
