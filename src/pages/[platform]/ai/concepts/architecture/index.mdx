The Amplify AI kit is built around the idea of routes. An AI route is like an API endpoint for interacting with backend AI functionality. AI routes are configured in an Amplify backend where you can define the authorization rules, what type of route (generation or conversation), AI model and inference configuration like temperature, what are the inputs and outputs, and what data it has access to. There are currently 2 types of AI routes:

* **Conversation:** A conversation route is an asynchronous, multi-turn API. Conversations and messages are automatically stored in DynamoDB. Examples of this are any chat-based AI experience or conversational UI.
* **Generation:** A single synchronous request-response API. A generation route is just an AppSync Query. Examples of this are: generating alt text for an image, generating structured data from unstructured input, summarization, etc.


## Cloud infrastructure

When you create an AI route with the Amplify AI kit, it is using these services:

### AWS AppSync
Acts as an API layer to authorize and route requests from the browser to AWS services. 

### Amazon DynamoDB
Serverless database for storing conversation history.

### AWS Lambda
Serverless execution for conversations. 

### Amazon Bedrock
Serverless foundation models
