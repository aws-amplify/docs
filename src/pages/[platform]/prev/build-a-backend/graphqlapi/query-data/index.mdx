You can read application data using the Amplify GraphQL client. In this guide, we will review the difference between reading data and getting data, how to filter query results to get just the data you need, and how to paginate results to make your data more manageable. We will also show you how to cancel these requests when needed.

Before you begin, you will need:

- An [application connected to the API](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/connect-to-api/)
- Data already created to view

## List and get your data

Queries are used to read data through the API and include the `list` and `get` operations.

The Amplify CLI automatically creates `list` and `get` queries for any @model type in your GraphQL API. The `list` query retrieves multiple items, such as Todo items, without needing to specific an identifier for a particular record. This is best suited for getting an overview or summary of items, or for enhancing the `list` operation to filter the items by specific criteria. When you want to query a single entry by an identifier, you would use `get` to retrieve a specific Todo item.

<Callout>

**Note:** The cost structure of your underlying data source can impact the cost to run some queries. For example, the `list` operation uses Amazon DynamoDB "scan operations," which can use more read request units than the `get` operation. You will want to review the associated costs for these operations for your data source. In our example, we are using DynamoDB. You can learn more about how DynamoDB costs are calculated by visiting [Amazon DynamoDB pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/).

</Callout>

The Amplify CLI automatically generates GraphQL client code for all possible GraphQL operations—mutations, queries, and subscriptions. For JavaScript applications, this generated code is saved in the `src/graphql` folder by default.

To run a GraphQL query, import the generated query and run it with `API.graphql`:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { ListTodosQuery, GetTodoQuery } from './API';

// Simple query
const allTodos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({
  query: queries.listTodos
});
console.log(allTodos); // result: { "data": { "listTodos": { "items": [/* ..... */] } } }

// Fetch a single record by its identifier
const oneTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<GetTodoQuery>>({
  query: queries.getTodo,
  variables: { id: 'some id' }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';

// Simple query
const allTodos = await API.graphql({ query: queries.listTodos });
console.log(allTodos); // result: { "data": { "listTodos": { "items": [/* ..... */] } } }

//Fetch a single record by its identifier
const oneTodo = await API.graphql({
  query: queries.getTodo,
  variables: { id: 'some id' }
});
```

<Accordion title='Troubleshoot unauthorized errors' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Troubleshooting'>

You can run into unauthorized errors if you don't have at least one auth rule defined.

Use the `@auth` directive to configure authorization rules for public, signed-in user, per-user, and per-user-group data access. **Authorization rules operate on the deny-by-default principle**, meaning that if an authorization rule is not specifically configured, it is denied.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the previous example, each signed-in user, or "owner", of a Todo can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

Amplify also allows you to restrict the allowed operations, combine multiple authorization rules, and apply fine-grained field-level authorization.

```graphql
type Todo
  @model
  @auth(rules: [{ allow: public, operations: [read] }, { allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the previous example, everyone (`public`) can read every Todo, but the `owner` (authenticated users) can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

To learn more, see [Authorization rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/) for the GraphQL API.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Custom authorization mode to query data' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Each AWS AppSync API uses a default authorization mode when you configure your app. To override this default, pass an `authMode` property. For example, this is useful when you have public reads through API Key auth and authenticated reads through IAM auth. The following examples show how you can query data with the custom authorization mode:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLQuery, GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import { GetTodoQuery } from './API';

const todos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<GetTodoQuery>>({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';

const todos = await API.graphql({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

</Accordion>

## Filter list queries

As your data grows, you will need to paginate your list queries. Fortunately, this is already built in to the Amplify-generated GraphQL API.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';

const variables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

<Accordion title='How do filters work?' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

You can find the input schemas in the **Docs** pane of the GraphQL explorer or inside your auto-generated `/graphql` folder. They look like this:

```graphql
listTodos(
  filter: ModelTodoFilterInput
  limit: Int
  nextToken: String): ModelTodoConnection

input ModelTodoFilterInput {
	id: ModelIDInput
	priority: ModelIntInput
	# ... all your other Todo fields here
	and: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	or: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	not: ModelTodoFilterInput
}
```

The input types in your schema indicate what kinds of filtering you can perform on them. For example, an integer field like `ModelIntInput` has this schema:

```graphql
input ModelIntInput {
  ne: Int # "not equal to"
  eq: Int # "equal to"
  le: Int # "less than or equal to"
  lt: Int # "less than"
  ge: Int # "greater than or equal to"
  gt: Int # "greater than"
  between: [Int]
  attributeExists: Boolean
  attributeType: ModelAttributeTypes
}
```

These filters vary based on the type of the field, but are linked to corresponding [Amazon DynamoDB queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Condition.html).

</Accordion>

### Compound filters

You can combine filters with `and`, `or`, and `not` Boolean logic. Observe, in the previous auto-generated schema, that `ModelTodoFilterInput` is recursive in respect to those fields. So if, for example, you wanted to filter for `priority` values of 1 _or_ 2, you would do this:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    or: [{ priority: { eq: 1 } }, { priority: { eq: 2 } }]
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';

const variables = {
  filter: {
    or: [{ priority: { eq: 1 } }, { priority: { eq: 2 } }]
  }
};

await API.graphql({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Note that querying for `priority` of 1 and 2 would return no results, because this is Boolean logic instead of natural language.

## Paginate list queries

To paginate your list query results, make a subsequent list query request with the `nextToken` and `limit` input variable set. The `limit` variable limits how many results are returned. The response will include a `nextToken` you can use to request the next page of data. A `nextToken` is a very long string that represents the cursor to the starting item of the next query made with these filters.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

// Fetch first 20 records
const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  limit: 20
  // add filter as needed
};

const res =
  (await API.graphql) <
  GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: variables
  });

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data?.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res =
  (await API.graphql) <
  GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: variables
  });

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data?.listTodos;
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';

// Fetch first 20 records
const variables = {
  limit: 20
  // add filter as needed
};

const res = await API.graphql({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res = await API.graphql({
  query: listTodos,
  variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data.listTodos;
```

<Accordion title='Implement pagination in your GraphQL API' headingLevel='3' eyebrow='Walkthrough'>

This brief walkthrough provides additional step-by-step guidance for implementing pagination.

When working with a large record set, you may want to only fetch the first **N** number of items. For example, let's start with a basic GraphQL schema for a Todo app:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
}
```

When the API is created with an `@model` directive, the following queries will automatically be created for you:

```graphql
type Query {
  getTodo(id: ID!): Todo
  listTodos(
    filter: ModelTodoFilterInput
    limit: Int
    nextToken: String
  ): ModelTodoConnection
}
```

Next, take a look at the `ModelTodoConnection` type to get an idea of the data that will be returned when the `listTodos` query is run:

```graphql
type ModelTodoConnection {
  items: [Todo]
  nextToken: String
}
```

When querying the API using the `listTodos` query, the return type will be of `ModelTodoConnection`, meaning you can return both an array of `Todos` and a `nextToken`.

The `nextToken` handles pagination. If the `nextToken` is `null`, that means there is no more data to return from the API. If the `nextToken` is present, you can use the value as an argument to the next `listTodos` query to return the next selection set from the API.

To test this, try creating five Todos using a mutation like this:

```sh
mutation createTodo {
  createTodo(input: {
    title: "Todo 1"
    description: "My first todo"
  }) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

Next, you can set the limit of the number of Todos in a query by specifying a `limit` argument. In this query, you will set the limit to two items and request a `nextToken` as a return value:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

Now, to query the next two items from the API, specify this `nextToken` as the argument:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2, nextToken: <your_token>) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

When there are no other items left to be returned, the `nextToken` in the response will be set to null.

#### Querying from a JavaScript application

The `listTodos` query is auto-generated by the CLI; for reference, it should look something like this:

```js
const listTodos = `
  query listTodos($limit: Int) {
    listTodos(limit: $limit) {
      items {
        id
        title
        description
      }
      nextToken
    }
  }
`;
```

To specify a `limit` in a query from a JavaScript application, you can use the following code by setting the limit as a variable:

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

async function fetchTodos() {
  const todoData = await API.graphql({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: {
      limit: 2
    }
  });
  console.log({ todoData });
}
```

The data returned from the API request should look like this (with the items array containing however many items have been created):

```graphql
{
  "data" {
    "listTodos" {
      "items": [{ id: "001", title: "Todo 1", description: "My first todo" }],
      "nextToken": "<token-id>"
    }
  }
}
```

To set the `nextToken` in a query from a JavaScript application, you can use the following code:

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

async function fetchTodos() {
  const todoData = await API.graphql({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: {
      limit: 2,
      nextToken: '<token-id>'
    }
  });
  console.log({ todoData });
}
```

**Limitations:**

- There is no API to get a total page count at this time. Note that scanning all items is a [potentially expensive operation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2901).
- Sorting is [available in DataStore](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/manipulate-data/#predicates) but not in AWS AppSync.
- AWS AppSync schemas do not follow the edges/nodes of the [Relay spec](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification) but are spiritually similar.
- You [cannot query by `page` number](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/5086); you have to query by `nextToken`.

## Cancel read requests

You may cancel any query or mutation request made through the API category by keeping a reference to the promise returned.

```javascript
const promise = API.graphql({ query: "..." });

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (API.isCancel(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
API.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `API.graphql()` has not been modified. Typically, async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will not work:

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return API.graphql({ query: '...' });
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
API.cancel(promise, 'my error message');
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the **Read application data** guide. In this guide, you learned how to read your data through `get` and `list` queries.

## Next steps
