The easiest way to get started with AWS Amplify is through [npm](https://npmjs.com) with [`create-amplify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-amplify), however it may be preferrable to start from scratch, either with an existing frontend app or a brand new directory.

To get started, we will walk you through initializing your project, install dependencies, and author your first backend.

First, create your project's `package.json` with `npm init -y`. Then, install the required dependencies for building a backend:

```bash
npm add --save-dev @aws-amplify/backend @aws-amplify/backend-cli typescript
```

Next, create the entrypoint for your backend, `amplify/backend.ts`, with the following contents:

```ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

defineBackend({});
```

Now you can run `npx amplify sandbox` to create your first backend!

<Callout warning>

Amplify (Gen 2) requires your backend to be configured for use with [ECMAScript Modules (ESM)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). If you encounter the following error during `amplify sandbox`, consider modifying your `package.json` with `"type": "module"`:

```text
The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require' calls; however, the referenced file is an ECMAScript module and cannot be imported with 'require'. Consider writing a dynamic 'import("@aws-amplify/backend")' call instead.
```

Or, you can create a file local to the Amplify backend directory, `amplify/package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

</Callout>

Moving forward, you can use other `define*` functions to _define_ additional resources, such as authentication:

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  }
});
```

This is how you will also define your data resource:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;
export const data = defineData({
  schema
});
```

Each of these newly-defined resources are then imported and set on the backend definition:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './resource/auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './resource/data/resource.js';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});
```
