The easiest way to get started with AWS Amplify is through [npm](https://npmjs.com) with [`create-amplify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-amplify), which is the workflow our [quickstart](/gen2/start/quickstart) recommends. However, for some use cases, it may be preferable to start from scratch, either with a brand new directory or an existing frontend app. This guide will walk you through how to initialize your project, install dependencies, and author your first backend.

## Manual setup

First, if your frontend framework of choice doesn't have it already, create your project's `package.json` with `npm init -y`. Then, install the Amplify dependencies for building a backend:

```bash
npm add --save-dev @aws-amplify/backend @aws-amplify/backend-cli typescript
```

<Callout info>

**Note**: TypeScript is not a requirement but is recommended for an optimal experience.

</Callout>

Next, create the entry point for your backend, `amplify/backend.ts`, with the following code:

```ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

defineBackend({});
```

Now you can run `npx amplify sandbox` to create your first backend!

<Callout warning>

Amplify (Gen 2) requires your backend to be configured for use with [ECMAScript modules (ESM)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html). If you encounter the following error during `amplify sandbox`, consider modifying your `package.json` with `"type": "module"`:

```text
The current file is a CommonJS module whose imports will produce 'require' calls; however, the referenced file is an ECMAScript module and cannot be imported with 'require'. Consider writing a dynamic 'import("@aws-amplify/backend")' call instead.
```

Or, you can create a local file in the Amplify backend directory, `amplify/package.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

</Callout>

You can use `define*` functions to _define_ your resources. For example, you can define authentication:

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  }
});
```

Or define your data resource:

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

const schema = a.schema({});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;
export const data = defineData({
  schema
});
```

Each of these newly defined resources are then imported and set in the backend definition:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});
```

## Upgrade existing projects

You can also update an existing frontend app. To upgrade existing Amplify code-first DX (Gen 2) apps, use your Node.js package manager (for example, `npm`) to update relevant backend packages:

```bash
npm update @aws-amplify/backend @aws-amplify/backend-cli
```
