This Configure guide will walk you through how to setup a local profile that will be used alongside the Amplify Sandbox to deploy cloud resources in your AWS account.

Before you get started, you will need to [create an AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start). Additionally, if you have not yet created an Amplify (Gen 2) app, visit the [quickstart](/gen2/start/quickstart).

Inside your Amplify (Gen 2) project, use [`amplify configure profile`](/gen2/reference/cli-commands#amplify-configure-profile) to configure your local AWS profile:

```bash
npx amplify configure profile
```

This command will prompt for a few details after creating your IAM user:

```console
npx amplify configure profile
? Do you already have IAM User credentials? (y/N) y
? Enter Access Key ID: [input is masked]
? Enter Secret Access Key: [input is masked]
? Enter the AWS region to use with the 'default' profile (eg us-east-1, us-west-2, etc): [input is masked]
Created profile default successfully!
```

Now you have a `default` profile written to `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials` and are ready to create your first cloud sandbox!
