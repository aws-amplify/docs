This quickstart guide will walk you through how to build a task-list app with TypeScript, Vite, and React. If you are new to these technologies, we recommend you go through the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), and official [React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) tutorials first.

## Create a project

From your project directory, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm create vite@latest react-amplify-gen2 -- --template react-ts
```

This creates a new React app in a directory called react-amplify-gen2. You can then run the following commands to switch into the new `react-amplify-gen2` directory and install the project dependencies:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
cd react-amplify-gen2
npm install
```

## Create a backend

The easiest way to get started with AWS Amplify is through npm with `create-amplify`.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm create amplify@latest
```

```console title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
? Where should we create your project? (.) # press enter
```

Running this command will scaffold a lightweight Amplify project in your current project with the following files:

```text
├── amplify/
│   ├── auth/
│   │   └── resource.ts
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── resource.ts
│   ├── backend.ts
│   └── package.json
├── node_modules/
├── .gitignore
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Start local dev server

Let's start a local dev server for your app development. For the frontend, run `npm run dev` to spin up a `localhost` dev server.

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npm run dev
```

<Callout info>

Now [configure your AWS account to use Amplify](/gen2/start/account-setup/). **Note:** If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your local machine, and you have configured the corresponding AWS profile with the **AmplifyBackendDeployFullAccess** permission policy, you can skip this step.

</Callout>

## Start Amplify sandbox

For the backend, you can start a cloud sandbox environment. Amplify gives every developer a personal cloud sandbox environment that provides isolated development spaces to rapidly build, test, and iterate. When you're working with a team, each developer will have their own personal cloud sandbox. In a new terminal window, run the following command:

```bash title="Terminal" showLineNumbers={false}
npx amplify sandbox
```

<Callout warning>Do not use cloud sandbox environments in production.</Callout>

You should now have these two commands running concurrently in different terminal windows.

<Fragments fragments={{ javascript: buildABackend, nextjs: buildABackend }} />

## Build UI

Let's add UI that connects to the backend data and auth resources.

### Add a login form

First, install the Amplify UI component library:

```bash
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

Next, configure the Amplify library client-side so it can interact with backend services.

Open `src/main.tsx` and add the following code below the last import:

```tsx title="src/main.tsx"
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from '../amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

Update the `src/App.tsx` file with the following code to import Amplify UI and wrap your app in the `withAuthenticator` function:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { withAuthenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, Amplify 👋</h1>
    </>
  );
}

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

Run your app with `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`. You should now see the authenticator, which is already configured and ready for your first sign-up! Create a new user account, confirm the account through email, and then sign in.

### View list of to-do items

Now, let's display data on our app's frontend. Create a `src/components` directory and then create a `TodoList.tsx` file within it with the following code:

```tsx title="src/components/TodoList.tsx"
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { generateClient } from "aws-amplify/data";
import type { Schema } from "../../amplify/data/resource";

export default function TodoList() {
  // generate your data client using the Schema from your backend
  const client = generateClient<Schema>();

  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Schema["Todo"][]>([]);

  async function listTodos() {
    // fetch all todos
    const { data } = await client.models.Todo.list();
    setTodos(data);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    listTodos();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>

      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.content}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In `src/App.tsx`, import `components/TodoList` and render it:

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import { withAuthenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";
import TodoList from "./components/TodoList";

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello, Amplify 👋</h1>
      <TodoList />
    </>
  );
}

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

Once you save the file and navigate back to `http://localhost:5173`, you should see a blank page for now because you have only an empty list of to-dos.

### Create a new to-do item

Let's update the return statement of the `components/TodoList` component to have a button for creating a new to-do list item, prompting the user to add the title and description. In a production app, you would want to create a full form, and run the create method on form submission.

```tsx title="src/components/TodoList.tsx"
// ...
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Todos</h1>
      <button onClick={async () => {
        // create a new Todo with the following attributes
        const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create({
          // prompt the user to enter the title
          content: window.prompt("title"),
          done: false,
          priority: 'medium'
        })
        console.log(errors, newTodo);
      }}>Create</button>

      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => (
          <li key={todo.id}>{todo.content}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Create a couple of to-dos, then refresh the page to see them. You can also subscribe to new to-dos in your `useEffect` to have them live-reload on the page.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  listTodos()
  const sub = client.models.Todo.observeQuery().subscribe(({ items }) =>
   setTodos([...items])
  );

  return () => sub.unsubscribe();
}, []);
```

### Terminate dev server

Go to `localhost` in the browser to make sure you can now log in and create and list to-dos. You can end your development session by shutting down the frontend dev server and cloud sandbox. The sandbox prompts you to delete your backend resources. While you can retain your backend, we recommend deleting all resources so you can start clean again next time.

## Deploy and host a fullstack branch

Now that your app is working, deploy it to a shared fullstack branch so you can share the project with your team.

Amplify offers a fully managed hosting service with CI/CD built in, making it easy to set up production and staging environments with Git branches. In Gen 2, every Git branch in your repository maps 1:1 to a fullstack branch in Amplify.

### Create remote Git repository

If you already have your project remotely hosted in a Git repository, you can skip this step. Otherwise, navigate to your preferred Git provider, and add your project to a new repository. Amplify supports [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo), [AWS CodeCommit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-create-repository.html), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/index.html), and [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/create-a-git-repository/).

### Connect branch in the Amplify console

1. To get started with Gen 2, log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?#amplify) and navigate to your preferred AWS Region. (The Amplify console is available in [19 AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/amplify.html#amplify_region)).
2. From the **Public Preview** banner, choose **Try Amplify Gen 2**.

![Amplify Gen 2 console showing the "Public Preview" banner with "Try Amplify Gen 2" button.](/images/gen2/getting-started/console1.png)

3. In the Git provider screen, choose **Option 2: Start with an existing app**. Connect the repository you just deployed and pick a branch.

<Callout warning>If you have an existing Gen-2 app, you can modify the build image by navigating to **Hosting > Environment variables** and creating a new environment variable `_CUSTOM_IMAGE` with the value `amplify:al2023`, then redeploy the build.</Callout>

4. Review all of your settings to ensure everything is set up correctly. Choose **Save and deploy** to deploy your web app.

### Manage fullstack branch

The new Amplify console gives you a central place to manage your branches, hosting settings, CI/CD builds, and backend resources. Even though you can access backend resources directly from AWS service consoles, the Amplify console offers built-in user and data administration.
