Fullstack previews give you the ability to set up ephemeral fullstack environments on every pull request. This allows you to test features in isolation from production. Once available, a normal workflow will look like the diagram below:

![previews](/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/previews.png)

1. Your `main` (production branch) and `featureA` branch is deployed on Amplify
1. Your team works on `featureA` until it's ready
1. `featureA` branch is updated to `main` HEAD and then a pull request to `main` is opened
1. The pull request preview is deployed on Amplify and available at `pr-1.appid.amplifyapp.com`
1. Once the pull request is merged to `main`, the request is closed and the fullstack environment is also automatically torn down
