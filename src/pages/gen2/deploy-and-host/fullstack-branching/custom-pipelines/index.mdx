While building with Amplify CI/CD offers benefits such as zero-config setup, fullstack previews, centralized secrets management, Amplify (Gen 2) makes it easy to integrate fullstack CI/CD into your custom pipelines (for example, AWS CodePipeline, Amazon CodeCatalyst, GitHub Actions, and more).

## Set up backend deployments

You can set up your backend deployments using the following steps:

1.  Create an Amplify app by connecting a fullstack Gen-2 branch from your Git repository. This is a one time setup as for subsequent deployments, we will be using a custom pipeline.

2.  Disable Auto-build for your branch. This will ensure code commits to your branch will not trigger a build.

</video>

3. Update the Amplify build-spec to add `npx amplify generate config --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID` and comment out the `pipeline-deploy` script. `amplify pipeline-deploy` runs a script to deploy backend updates, while `amplify generate config` fetches the latest `amplifyconfiguration.json` for the specified environment.

4. Now go to your pipeline provider and update the build settings to include the following:
    * Run `npm ci`.
    * Run `export CI=1` to tell the deployment script that is a CI environment.
    * Run `npx amplify pipeline-deploy --branch BRANCH_NAME --app-id AMPLIFY_APP_ID`. `BRANCH_NAME` refers to the branch you're deploying. `AMPLIFY_APP_ID` is the Amplify project ID. You can find this by going to the Amplify console and navigating to _backend-app > App settings > App ARN_ and copying the ID located at the end of the string `arn:aws:amplify:<region>:<account-id>:apps/*app-id*`.

The example below demonstrates how you would set up the build-spec when using Amazon CodeCatalyst.

```yaml
Actions:
  Build_82:
    # Identifies the action. Do not modify this value.
    Identifier: aws/build@v1.0.0
    # Specifies the source and/or artifacts to pass to the action as input.
    Inputs:
      # Optional
      Sources:
        - WorkflowSource # This specifies that the action requires this Workflow as a source
      Variables:
        - Name: BRANCH_NAME
          Value: main
        - Name: AMPLIFY_APP_ID
          Value: #####
    Configuration:
      # Required - Steps are sequential instructions that run shell commands
      Steps:
        - Run: export CI=1
        - Run: npm ci
        - Run: npx amplify pipeline-deploy --branch $BRANCH_NAME --app-id $AMPLIFY_APP_ID
```
5. Trigger a `git push` to your branch. Your build logs should show that there is an AWS CloudFormation deployment underway.

## Set up frontend deployments

If you want to complete the fullstack CI/CD setup, we have to build, deploy, and host the frontend in addition to the backend.

1. Use the AWS CLI to create an [incoming webhook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/webhooks.html) for your Amplify app. If the command executes successfully, you should see a response printed out like below:

```
aws amplify create-webhook --app-id AMPLIFY-APPID --branch-name main  --region REGION
{
    "webhook": {
        "webhookArn": "arn:aws:amplify:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID:apps/APPID/webhooks/WEBHOOK-ID",
        "webhookId": "WEBHOOK-ID",
        "webhookUrl": "https://webhooks.amplify.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhooks?id=WEBHOOK-ID&token=TOKEN",
        "branchName": "main",
        "createTime": "2023-11-19T19:09:42.461000-08:00",
        "updateTime": "2023-11-19T19:09:42.461000-08:00"
    }
}
```

2. Construct a `curl` command with the `webhookUrl`: `curl -X POST -d {} "https://webhooks.amplify.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhooks?id=WEBHOOK-ID&token=TOKEN&operation=startbuild" -H "Content-Type:application/json`

3. Now update your custom-pipeline build settings to include the `curl` command to trigger a frontend build after the `pipeline-deploy` succeeds. Using the same Amazon CodeCatalyst example above, this step includes:

``` yaml
    Configuration:
      # Required - Steps are sequential instructions that run shell commands
      Steps:
        - Run: export CI=1
        - Run: npm ci
        - Run: npx amplify pipeline-deploy --branch $BRANCH_NAME --app-id $AMPLIFY_APP_ID
        - Run: if [ $BRANCH_NAME = "main" ]; then curl -X POST -d {}
            "https://webhooks.amplify.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/webhooks?id=WEBHOOK-ID&token=TOKEN&operation=startbuild"
            -H "Content-Type:application/json"; fi
```

4. This should trigger a build in your Amplify app. Amplify CI will build and first generate the `amplifyconfiguration.json` for the branch and then build, deploy, and host the frontend.
