Sometimes you may not want to deploy new resources for every branch. For example you might want all your `feature` branches point to the backend resources deployed by the `dev` branch so you can reuse seed data, users, groups etc.

To do this update your app build settings, navigate to your build settings from the App overview.

![build-settings](/images/gen2/fullstack-branching/build-settings.png)

Update the build settings for the `backend` phase to run `npx amplify generate config --branch dev app-id $AWS_APP_ID` to generate the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file for all branches other than `main` or `dev`. So any new branches that get deployed will not deploy any backend resources as part of the build and instead use the deployed backend resources from the `dev` branch.

```yaml
version: 1
backend:
  phases:
    build:
      commands:
        - nvm use 18
        - npm ci
        - |
          if [ "${AWS_BRANCH}" = "main" ] || [ "${AWS_BRANCH}" = "dev" ]; then 
            npx amplify pipeline-deploy --branch $AWS_BRANCH --app-id $AWS_APP_ID 
          else
            npx amplify generate config  --branch dev --app-id $AWS_APP_ID 
          fi
