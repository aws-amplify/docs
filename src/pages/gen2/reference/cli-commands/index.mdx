This page serves as a reference for commands found in the [`@aws-amplify/backend-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/backend-cli) package.

All commands can be prefixed with [AWS CLI Environment Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list) to change the AWS account behavior with Amplify (Gen 2) commands.

## amplify sandbox

Sandbox enables you to develop your backend alongside your frontend's development server. This command will automatically watch for changes in `amplify/`, and redeploy each time you save a file. Run `npx amplify sandbox` to deploy to your personal cloud sandbox.

### Options

- `--dir-to-watch` (_string_) - Directory to watch for file changes. All subdirectories and files will be included
- `--exclude` (_string[]_) - An array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. Paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories
- `--name` (_string_) - An optional name to distinguish between different sandbox environments. Default is the name in your package.json
- `--config-out-dir` (_string_) - A path to a directory where the client config file is written. If not provided, defaults to current process working directory
- `--config-format` (_string_) - Format in which the client config file is written (choices: `mjs`, `json`, `json-mobile`, `ts`, `dart`)
- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name

### Usage

```bash
amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with an alternate profile

You can use the `--profile` flag to run sandbox with an AWS profile other than `default`:

```bash
amplify sandbox --profile my-other-profile
```

Additionally, you can leverage AWS CLI environment variables to use a different profile:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-other-profile amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with an alternate region

Leverage AWS environment variables to deploy to a region other than your AWS profile's configured region:

```bash
AWS_REGION=us-west-2 amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with mobile applications

For mobile applications you will need to set the output directory and format of the generated configuration file (`amplifyconfiguration.json`):

```bash
# for Android
amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile --config-out-dir app/src/main/res
```

```bash
# for Swift/iOS
amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile
```

```bash
# for Flutter
amplify sandbox --config-format dart --config-out-dir lib
```

## amplify sandbox delete

Delete your personal cloud sandbox. This should only be used if you have an active cloud sandbox that you opted to _not_ delete when exiting `npx amplify sandbox`.

### Options

- `--name` (_string_) - An optional name to distinguish between different sandbox environments. Default is the name in your package.json
- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name
- `-y, --yes` (_boolean_) - Do not ask for confirmation before deleting the sandbox environment

### Usage

```bash
amplify sandbox delete
```

## amplify sandbox secret

Manage backend secrets used with your personal cloud sandbox.

### Options

- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name

### Usage

```bash
amplify sandbox secret
```

#### Using with an alternate AWS profile

You can use the `--profile` flag to run sandbox with an AWS profile other than `default`:

```bash
amplify sandbox secret list --profile my-other-profile
```

Additionally, you can leverage AWS environment variables to use a different profile:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-other-profile amplify sandbox secret list
```

#### Creating a secret

Create secrets for use with your personal cloud sandbox by using `sandbox secret set`:

```bash
amplify sandbox secret set LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
```

This is how you configure secrets to be retrieved and used within your backend using `secret()`.

#### Removing a secret

If you wish to remove a secret you previously set, use `sandbox secret remove`:

```bash
amplify sandbox secret remove LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
```

#### Listing secrets

List all available secrets for your personal sandbox in the default AWS profile and region:

```bash
amplify sandbox secret list
```

#### Get a secret and view its details

You can view an existing secret and its details such as the current version and when it was last updated:

```console
amplify sandbox secret get LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
 name: LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
 version: 1
 value: ****
 lastUpdated: Fri Nov 17 2023 12:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

## amplify generate

Generate is not intended to be used standalone, however offers a few subcommands to generate information or code that is supplemental to your frontend development.

Each of the following `generate` subcommands require either a CloudFormation stack name or an existing Amplify App ID and corresponding git branch:

```bash
# with CloudFormation stack name
amplify generate <subcommand> --stack <cloudformation-stack-name>
```

```bash
# with Amplify App ID and git branch
amplify generate <subcommand> --app-id <app-id> --branch <git-branch-name>
```

## amplify generate config

Generate the client configuration file (e.g. `amplifyconfiguration.json`) for your frontend application to consume. This is intended to be used to manually generate a configuration file for an environment other than your personal cloud sandbox. For example, if you would like to verify something your coworker is seeing in their cloud sandbox, or if you would like to demonstrate frontend changes locally using a pre-existing "staging" branch.

### Options

In addition to the required options noted in [`amplify generate`](#amplify-generate):

- `--profile` (_string_): An AWS profile name
- `--format` (_string_): The format which the configuration should be exported into (choices: `mjs`, `json`, `json-mobile`, `ts`, `dart`)
- `--out-dir` (_string_): A path to directory where config is written. If not provided defaults to current process working directory

### Usage

As mentioned above, you can specify a team member's cloud sandbox CloudFormation stack:

```bash
amplify generate config --stack amplify-nextamplifygen2-josef-sandbox-ca85e1081b
```

#### Use with mobile applications

Similar to `sandbox`, you can specify an alternate configuration file format by using `--format`:

```bash
amplify generate config --stack amplify-nextamplifygen2-josef-sandbox-ca85e1081b --format json-mobile
```
