This page serves as a reference for commands found in the [`@aws-amplify/backend-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/backend-cli) package.

All commands can be prefixed with [AWS CLI environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html#envvars-list) to change the AWS account behavior with Amplify (Gen 2) commands.

## npx amplify sandbox

Sandbox enables you to develop your backend alongside your frontend's development server. This command will automatically watch for changes in `amplify/`, and redeploy each time you save a file. Run `npx amplify sandbox` to deploy to your personal cloud sandbox.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox">Options</SubCommandHeading>

- `--dir-to-watch` (_string_) - Directory to watch for file changes. All subdirectories and files will be included.
- `--exclude` (_string[]_) - An array of paths or glob patterns to ignore. Paths can be relative or absolute and can either be files or directories.
- `--name` (_string_) - An optional name to distinguish between different sandbox environments. Default is the name in your package.json.
- `--config-out-dir` (_string_) - A path to a directory where the client config file is written. If not provided, defaults to the working directory of the current process.
- `--config-format` (_string_) - Format in which the client config file is written (choices: `mjs`, `json`, `json-mobile`, `ts`, `dart`).
- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox">Usage</SubCommandHeading>

```bash
npx amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with an alternate profile

You can use the `--profile` flag to run sandbox with an AWS profile other than `default`:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox --profile my-other-profile
```

Additionally, you can use AWS CLI environment variables to specify a different profile:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-other-profile amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with an alternate Region

Use AWS environment variables to deploy to a Region other than your AWS profile's configured Region:

```bash
AWS_REGION=us-west-2 amplify sandbox
```

#### Use with mobile applications

For mobile applications, you will need to set the output directory and format of the generated configuration file, specifically `amplifyconfiguration.json`:

```bash
# for Android
amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile --config-out-dir app/src/main/res
```

```bash
# for Swift/iOS
amplify sandbox --config-format json-mobile
```

```bash
# for Flutter
amplify sandbox --config-format dart --config-out-dir lib
```

## npx amplify sandbox delete

Delete your personal cloud sandbox. This should only be used if you have an active cloud sandbox that you opted to _not_ delete when exiting `npx amplify sandbox`.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox-delete">Options</SubCommandHeading>

- `--name` (_string_) - An optional name to distinguish between different sandbox environments. Default is the name in your package.json.
- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name.
- `-y, --yes` (_boolean_) - Do not ask for confirmation before deleting the sandbox environment.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox-delete">Usage</SubCommandHeading>

```bash
npx amplify sandbox delete
```

## npx amplify sandbox secret

Manage backend secrets used with your personal cloud sandbox.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox-secret">Options</SubCommandHeading>

- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-sandbox-secret">Usage</SubCommandHeading>

```bash
npx amplify sandbox secret
```

#### Using with an alternate AWS profile

You can use the `--profile` flag to run sandbox with an AWS profile other than `default`:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox secret list --profile my-other-profile
```

Additionally, you can use AWS environment variables to specify a different profile:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=my-other-profile amplify sandbox secret list
```

#### Creating a secret

Create secrets for use with your personal cloud sandbox by using `sandbox secret set`:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox secret set LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
```

This is how you configure secrets to be retrieved and used within your backend using `secret()`.

#### Removing a secret

If you want to remove a secret you previously set, use `sandbox secret remove`:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox secret remove LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
```

#### Listing secrets

List all available secrets for your personal sandbox in the default AWS profile and Region:

```bash
npx amplify sandbox secret list
```

#### Get a secret and view its details

You can view an existing secret and its details, such as the current version and when it was last updated:

```console
amplify sandbox secret get LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
 name: LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID
 version: 1
 value: ****
 lastUpdated: Fri Nov 17 2023 12:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)
```

## npx amplify generate

Generate is not intended to be used standalone; however, it does offer a few subcommands to generate information or code that is supplemental to your frontend development.

Each of the following `generate` subcommands require either a CloudFormation stack name or an existing Amplify App ID and corresponding git branch:

```bash
# with CloudFormation stack name
npx amplify generate <subcommand> --stack <cloudformation-stack-name>
```

```bash
# with Amplify App ID and git branch
npx amplify generate <subcommand> --app-id <app-id> --branch <git-branch-name>
```

## npx amplify generate config

Generate the client configuration file (such as `amplifyconfiguration.json`) for your frontend application to consume. This is intended to be used to manually generate a configuration file for an environment other than your personal cloud sandbox. For example, you might use it if you would like to verify something your coworker is seeing in their cloud sandbox, or to demonstrate frontend changes locally using a pre-existing "staging" branch.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-generate-config">Options</SubCommandHeading>

In addition to the required options noted in [`amplify generate`](#amplify-generate):

- `--profile` (_string_) - An AWS profile name.
- `--format` (_string_) - The format into which the configuration should be exported (choices: `mjs`, `json`, `json-mobile`, `ts`, `dart`).
- `--out-dir` (_string_) - A path to the directory where config is written. If not provided, it defaults to the working directory of the current process.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-generate-config">Usage</SubCommandHeading>

As mentioned above, you can specify a team member's cloud sandbox CloudFormation stack:

```bash
npx amplify generate config --stack amplify-nextamplifygen2-josef-sandbox-ca85e1081b
```

#### Use with mobile applications

Similar to `sandbox`, you can specify an alternate configuration file format by using `--format`:

```bash
npx amplify generate config --stack amplify-nextamplifygen2-josef-sandbox-ca85e1081b --format json-mobile
```

## npx amplify generate graphql-client-code

Generate GraphQL statements for your frontend application to consume.

{/* @TODO */}

## npx amplify generate forms

Generate React form components derived from your backend data models for your frontend application to consume.

{/* @TODO */}

## npx amplify info

Generates information on system, binaries, NPM packages, and environment variables for troubleshooting Amplify issues.

## npx amplify pipeline-deploy

Deploys the Amplify project in a CI/CD pipeline for a specified Amplify app and branch.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-pipeline-deploy">Options</SubCommandHeading>

- `--branch` (_string_) - Name of the git branch being deployed.
- `--app-id` (_string_) - The app id of the target Amplify app.
- `--config-out-dir` (_string_) - A path to a directory where the client config file is written. If not provided, defaults to the working directory of the current process.

<SubCommandHeading parentCommand="amplify-pipeline-deploy">Usage</SubCommandHeading>

```bash
npx amplify pipeline-deploy --branch $BRANCH_NAME --app-id $AMPLIFY_APP_ID
```
