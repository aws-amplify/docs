In Amplify (Gen 2), the CLI will generate an `amplifyconfiguration.json` file with a similar structure to the configuration files generated by Amplify (Gen 1). Locally, this file is created while using `amplify sandbox`. In Amplify's CI/CD, this is created automatically for you based on the current Amplify app ID and git branch.

You can also manually create this file for a specified Amplify app ID and branch, or an AWS CloudFormation stack name with [`amplify generate config`](/gen2/reference/cli-commands#amplify-generate-config).
