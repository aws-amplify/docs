Amplify (Gen 2) collects anonymous telemetry data about general usage of the CLI. Participation is optional, and you may [opt out](#how-do-i-opt-out) by using `amplify configure telemetry disable`.

Your decision to opt out is stored for your user, meaning all Amplify apps you work with on that computer will not send telemetry data.

## How do I opt out?

You may opt out by using the `configure telemetry disable` command from the root of your Amplify app:

```bash
npx amplify configure telemetry disable
```

You can opt back in to the program by running the following from the root of your Amplify app:

```bash
npx amplify configure telemetry enable
```

In the event you would like to disable telemetry on a one-time basis, you can opt out by defining an environment variable:

```bash
AMPLIFY_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```
