Here you will find a collection of backend components known as "constructs" for use with [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

## Amplify Data

The official `AmplifyData` construct can be found on [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/@aws-amplify/data-construct/?lang=typescript).

> This package vends an L3 CDK Construct wrapping the behavior of the Amplify GraphQL Transformer. This enables quick development and interation of AppSync APIs which support the Amplify GraphQL Directives.

For more information on data modeling [visit the data modeling documentation](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/data-modeling).

## Amplify Auth (alpha)

The official `AmplifyAuth` construct is currently in alpha and is not yet suitable for production use in your CDK applications. It can be found on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-amplify/auth-construct-alpha).
