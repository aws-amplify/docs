## Stack Names

### Branch

The stack name for all environments follows the pattern:

```
amplify-{appName}-{disambiguator}-{branchName}
```

In the case of Amplify branch environments, this maps to:

```
amplify-{appName}-{appId}-{branchName}
```

### Sandbox

For sandbox environments this maps to:

```
amplify-{package.json#name}-{$(whoami) | "name" arg}-sandbox
```

When running `amplify sandbox` the `package.json#name` is loaded from disc and `$(whoami)` will execute on the local machine to construct the stack name.

$(whoami) is likely to be unique for developers working on a given project, but if not, an optional argument is available for developers to avoid collisions:

```bash
amplify sandbox --name something
```

Running this command would deploy a stack named

```
amplify-{package.json#name}-something-sandbox
```

If you are using a named sandbox, create a local alias to prevent having to type the arg all the time:

```
alias amplify-sandbox='npx amplify sandbox --name something'
```
