You can generate React forms that automatically connect to your data backend by calling the Amplify CLI:

```bash
npx amplify generate forms
```

This will generate create and update forms for each model defined in your schema.

**Note:** You will need to have a sandbox environment or a deployed environment to generate forms for your application.
