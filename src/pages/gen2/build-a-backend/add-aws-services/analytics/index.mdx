Amplify enables you to collect analytics data for your app. The Analytics category uses Amazon Cognito Identity pools to _identify_ users in your app.
The following is an example utilizing the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) to create the an Analytics resource powered by [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/).

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { Policy, PolicyStatement } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-iam";
import { CfnApp } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-pinpoint";

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data,
  // additional resources
});

const analyticsStack = backend.createStack("analytics-stack");

// create a Pinpoint app
const pinpoint = new CfnApp(analyticsStack, "Pinpoint", {
  name: "myPinpointApp",
});

// create an IAM policy to allow interacting with Pinpoint
const pinpointPolicy = new Policy(analyticsStack, "PinpointPolicy", {
  policyName: "PinpointPolicy",
  statements: [
    new PolicyStatement({
      actions: ["mobiletargeting:UpdateEndpoint", "mobiletargeting:PutEvents"],
      resources: [pinpoint.attrArn + "/*"],
    }),
  ],
});

// apply the policy to the authenticated and unauthenticated roles
backend.auth.resources.authenticatedUserIamRole.attachInlinePolicy(pinpointPolicy);
backend.auth.resources.unauthenticatedUserIamRole.attachInlinePolicy(pinpointPolicy);

// patch the custom Pinpoint resource to the expected output configuration
backend.addOutput({
  Analytics: {
    AWSPinpoint: {
      appId: pinpoint.ref,
      region: Stack.of(pinpoint).region,
    },
  },
});
```

### Initialize Analytics

To initialize Analytics you need to configure Amplify with `Amplify.configure()`

### Working with Analytics

Refer to the [Analytics documentation](/react/build-a-backend/more-features/analytics/) to learn how to track events and user sessions in your app.
