**Coming soon:** The Storage experience for Amplify (Gen 2) is still under development. You can add Amazon S3 to your Amplify (Gen 2) project with the AWS CDK.

</Callout>

To use Storage today, you must use the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/), which is installed by default as part of the [`create-amplify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-amplify) workflow. 

To get started, modify your project's `backend.ts` file to create an Amazon S3 bucket and grant Amplify-generated resources access to read and write:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
// amplify/backend.ts
import * as s3 from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-s3';
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

// create the bucket and its stack
const bucketStack = backend.createStack('BucketStack');
const bucket = new s3.Bucket(bucketStack, 'Bucket', {
  blockPublicAccess: s3.BlockPublicAccess.BLOCK_ALL
});

// allow any authenticated user to read and write to the bucket
const authRole = backend.auth.resources.authenticatedUserIamRole;
bucket.grantReadWrite(authRole);

// allow any guest (unauthenticated) user to read from the bucket
const unauthRole = backend.auth.resources.unauthenticatedUserIamRole;
bucket.grantRead(unauthRole);
```

Finally, run `npx amplify sandbox` to create your first Amazon S3 bucket!
