In this guide, you will set up sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out using the Amplify Libraries and then test this functionality. This includes a review of sign-up methods provided by Amplify, the specific user attributes used by Amazon Cognito, how to confirm users after initial sign-up, and the differences between local and global sign-out. Once set up, you can connect this functionality to your frontend UI.

<Callout>

This guide is for those who want to set up Amplify Auth with the Amplify Libraries. If you want to create a sign-in and registration experience for your app with a few lines of code, we recommend using the [Authenticator component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator), which provides a customizable UI and complete authentication flows.

</Callout>

Before you begin, you should have finished the [_Create your first authentication resource_](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/set-up-auth/#create-your-first-authentication-resource) section of the _Set up Amplify Auth_ guide. In that guide we showed how to configure the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file to enable your users to sign up to your application using a username and password. We will be continuing with examples of how to further customize those sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out workflows in this guide.

## Decide before you build

Before you enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out, you will need to make a few decisions to complete the process.

<Accordion title='Review the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out workflow' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Below is a high-level overview of the workflows for sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out with Amplify authentication:

**Sign-up:** The username and password setup will ask your user for a username (or email) and a password. This should also include any attributes you include in your sign-up form, such as address, birthdate, and phone. When your end user submits this information, it is then passed through the `signUp()` API to your Amazon Cognito User Pool, where a user is created. By default, the user will receive a confirmation message by email or SMS, depending on what you configured, but you also have the option to auto-confirm your users after they sign up. Users must then enter the confirmation code to complete the sign-up process. Once the user is verified, their user profile is officially confirmed and is active in the Cognito User Pool. The profile contains the username, password, and any other attributes collected during sign-up. This user profile can then be used to sign in and access your application.

**Sign-in:** The user enters the username and password they created on sign-up and submits the form in your application to sign in. The application will then call the `signIn()` API to sign in the user by passing the username and password to verify and establish a session with Amazon Cognito, which will then generate the needed tokens to grant access. Amazon Cognito issues temporary short-lived tokens on sign-in (default of 1 hour), but you can update these settings to keep your users signed in for longer (up to 24 hours).

**Sign-out:** Amplify uses the `signOut()` API to sign out the user by ending the current session and revoking the tokens with Amazon Cognito. This clears the user session in the browser and the application will then navigate the user to the sign-in screen.

</Accordion>

### Which Amazon Cognito attributes will you pass for sign-up?

User attributes such as `email` are used to identify your users. These are set up when you configure your Cognito User Pool and cannot be renamed or deleted after they are added. You can modify your backend authentication resource to include additional User attributes.

```diff title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
  },
+ userAttributes: {
+   birthdate: {
+     required: false,
+     mutable: false,
+   },
+ },
});
```

<Callout>

User attributes such as `email` and `phoneNumber` are required and automatically configured if you specify `email` or `phone` as how you would like your user's to `loginWith`. Additional user attributes are not required, however you can specify additional, required user attributes.

</Callout>

### How will you verify users at sign-up?

Once the initial sign-up is done, the user will need to verify and confirm their contact information before their account is activated. This is done by sending a verification code by email or phone number that can be collected on initial sign-up. Email verification asks the user to click a link or enter a code sent to their email address provided during sign-up. Phone verification is done by asking the user to enter the code sent to them in an SMS text message. You can also enable auto-confirmation to skip this step and automatically confirm the user after sign-up. This is accomplished using the pre sign-up Lambda trigger, which is explained in the [Amazon Cognito documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-sign-up.html).

Once you have these decisions in mind, you are ready to enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.

## Add the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out capabilities

You can add the functionality to enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out with the Amplify Libraries. You can connect this to an existing UI or create your own.

For many apps, user sign-up and sign-in with a username and password is all that is required. Once authenticated, the app can talk to an API to access and mutate data. This is the method we illustrated in the [_Set up Amplify Auth_](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/set-up-auth/) guide.

We will use the username and password authentication flow to get started. Both [third-party social provider federation](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/add-social-provider/) and [Multi-factor authentication](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa/) can be added after this initial setup.

### Sign-up

You can create a new user in your backend by passing a username, password, and other attributes to `signUp()`.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signUp } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

type SignUpParameters = {
  username: string;
  password: string;
  email: string;
  phone_number: string;
};

async function handleSignUp({
  username,
  password,
  email,
  phone_number
}: SignUpParameters) {
  try {
    const { isSignUpComplete, userId, nextStep } = await signUp({
      username,
      password,
      options: {
        userAttributes: {
          email,
          phone_number // E.164 number convention
        },
        // optional
        autoSignIn: true // or SignInOptions e.g { authFlowType: "USER_SRP_AUTH" }
      }
    });

    console.log(userId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing up:', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { signUp } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignUp({ username, password, email, phone_number }) {
  try {
    const { isSignUpComplete, userId, nextStep } = await signUp({
      username,
      password,
      options: {
        userAttributes: {
          email,
          phone_number // E.164 number convention
        },
        // optional
        autoSignIn: true // or SignInOptions e.g { authFlowType: "USER_SRP_AUTH" }
      }
    });

    console.log(userId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing up:', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

The `signUp` API response will include a `nextStep` property, which can be used to determine if further action is required. It may return the following next steps:

- `CONFIRM_SIGN_UP` - The sign up needs to be confirmed by collecting a code from the user and calling `confirmSignUp`.
- `DONE` - The sign up process has been fully completed.
- `COMPLETE_AUTO_SIGN_IN` - The sign up process needs to complete by invoking the `autoSignIn` API.

#### Update the password format

Using password policy in your `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file, you can customize the format acceptable by your auth backend. By default your password policy is set to the following:

- `MinLength`: 8 characters
- `requireLowercase`: true
- `requireUppercase`: true
- `requireDigits`: true
- `tempPasswordValidity`: 3 days

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
// amplify/backend.ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

// extract L1 UserPool construct
const { cfnUserPool } = backend.auth.resources.cfnResources;
// from the CDK use `addPropertyOverride` to modify properties directly
cfnUserPool.addPropertyOverride('Policies.PasswordPolicy.MinimumLength', 32);
```

## Customize Cognito UserPool email verification settings

You can change the verification email by overriding the `verificationEmailStyle` and the `verificationEmailBody`.

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: {
      verificationEmailStyle: "CODE",
      verificationEmailBody: (code: string) =>
        `Welcome! Your verification code is ${code}.`,
      verificationEmailSubject: "Welcome! Here is your verification code",
    },
  },
});
```

### Confirm sign-up

By default, each user that signs up remains in the unconfirmed status until they verify with a confirmation code that was sent to their email or phone number. The following are the default verification methods used when either `phone` or `email` are used as `loginWith` options.

| Login option        | User account verification channel |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `phone`             | Phone Number                      |
| `email`             | Email                             |
| `email` and `phone` | Email                             |

You can confirm the sign-up after retrieving a confirmation code from the user as shown here.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { confirmSignUp, type ConfirmSignUpInput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignUpConfirmation({
  username,
  confirmationCode
}: ConfirmSignUpInput) {
  try {
    const { isSignUpComplete, nextStep } = await confirmSignUp({
      username,
      confirmationCode
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error confirming sign up', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { confirmSignUp } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignUpConfirmation({ username, confirmationCode }) {
  try {
    const { isSignUpComplete, nextStep } = await confirmSignUp({
      username,
      confirmationCode
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error confirming sign up', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Auto sign-in

The `autoSignIn` API will automatically sign-in a user when it was previously enabled by the `signUp` API and after any of the following cases has completed:

- User confirmed their account with a verification code sent to their phone or email (default option).
- User confirmed their account with a verification link sent to their phone or email. In order to enable this option you need to set `loginWith.email.verificationEmailStyle` to `LINK` in your auth resource file (`amplify/auth/resource.ts`)

```ts
import { autoSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleAutoSignIn() {
  try {
    const signInOutput = await autoSignIn();
    // handle sign-in steps
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Sign-in

You pass a username and password to the `signIn` API to sign-in your end-users.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signIn, type SignInInput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn({ username, password }: SignInInput) {
  try {
    const { isSignedIn, nextStep } = await signIn({ username, password });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing in', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function signIn({ username, password }) {
  try {
    const { isSignedIn, nextStep } = await signIn({ username, password });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing in', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

The `signIn` API response will include a `nextStep` property, which can be used to determine if further action is required. It may return the following next steps:

- `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` - The user was created with a temporary password and must set a new one. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_CUSTOM_CHALLENGE` - The sign-in must be confirmed with a custom challenge response. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_CODE` - The sign-in must be confirmed with a TOTP code from the user. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` - The TOTP setup process must be continued. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `CONFIRM_SIGN_IN_WITH_SMS_CODE` - The sign-in must be confirmed with a SMS code from the user. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_MFA_SELECTION` - The user must select their mode of MFA verification before signing in. Complete the process with `confirmSignIn`.
- `RESET_PASSWORD` - The user must reset their password via `resetPassword`.
- `CONFIRM_SIGN_UP` - The user hasn't completed the sign-up flow fully and must be confirmed via `confirmSignUp`.
- `DONE` - The sign in process has been completed.

For more information on handling the TOTP and MFA steps that may be returned, please see [_'Multi-factor authentication'_](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa/).

### Guest access

Guest access is enabled by default for your Amplify Auth resources. You can override this default behavior by using CDK as follows:

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
// amplify/backend.ts
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

// extract the L1 IdentityPool construct
const { cfnIdentityPool } = backend.auth.resources.cfnResources;
// from the CDK use `addPropertyOverride` to modify properties directly
cfnIdentityPool.addPropertyOverride('AllowUnauthenticatedIdentities', false);
```

### Sign-out

To sign a user out of your application you can use the `signOut` API.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignOut() {
  try {
    await signOut();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignOut() {
  try {
    await signOut();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

You can also sign out users from all devices by performing a global sign-out. This will also invalidate all refresh tokens issued to a user. The user's current access and ID tokens will remain valid on other devices until the refresh token expires (access and ID tokens expire one hour after they are issued).

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignOut() {
  try {
    await signOut({ global: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignOut() {
  try {
    await signOut({ global: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('error signing out: ', error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Once you implement the Amplify Library methods within your application, you can test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Enable sign-up, sign-in, sign-out** guide and verified the functionality works as expected.

### Next steps

Now that you completed setting up Amplify Auth with username and password, you may also want to add some additional features. We recommend:

- [Add social provider sign-in](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/add-social-provider/)
- [Multi-factor authentication](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa/)
