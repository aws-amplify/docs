We do not yet have out-of-the-box support for Admin queries in Amplify (Gen 2). You will have to a create a new [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) resource, and provide it with the necessary permissions to access the [Amazon Cognito Admin Actions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html) behind the scenes.
