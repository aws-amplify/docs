You can enable the use of sign-in with social providers using the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file. With Amplify Auth, you can enable your users to Sign in With Apple, Sign in with Google, Login with Amazon, and Facebook.

In this guide we will review how you can add sign-in with social providers by first setting up your developer account with the provider. After this step, you can then configure your Auth category and integrate social sign-in with your app.

If you have not yet created an Amplify (Gen 2) app, visit the [quickstart](/gen2/start/quickstart).

<Accordion title='Review how OAuth authentication works' headingLevel='3' eyebrow='Learn more'>

The preferred way to incorporate social provider sign-in is via an OAuth redirect which lets users sign in using their social media account and creates a corresponding user in the Cognito User Pool.

[OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is the common Authorization framework used by web and mobile applications for accessing user information ("scopes") in a limited manner. Common analogies you will hear in OAuth is that of boarding a plane or staying in a hotel - showing your identification is the authentication piece (signing into an app) and using the boarding pass/hotel key is what you are authorized to access.

OAuth support in Amplify uses Cognito User Pools and supports federation with social providers, which will automatically create a corresponding user in the User Pool after they sign in. With this design you do not need to include an SDK for the social provider in your app. After you set up your developer account with these social providers you can configure by specifying `externalProviders` under `loginWith`. You can then use `signInWithRedirect()` in your app to either show a pre-built "Hosted UI" or pass in a provider name (e.g. `signInWithRedirect({ provider: 'Facebook' })`) to interface directly and build your own UI. ![Image](/images/SocialAuthZ.png)

## Set up your social auth provider

Before you configure social sign-in with Amplify Auth you will need to set up your developer account with each provider you are using.

**Note:** Amazon Cognito provides first class support for Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple for seamless setup. However you can configure other Identity Providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC).

Your developer accounts with the social providers are now set up and you can return to the Amplify specific configuration.

## Configure social sign-in backend

In `amplify/auth/resource.ts` the social providers need to be added.

The following is an example of how you would set up access to all of the social providers supported by Amplify Auth. You also need to configure your `callbackUrls` and `logoutUrls` URLs for your application, which will inform your backend resources how to behave when initiating sign in and sign out operations in your app.

<Callout>

Secrets must be created manually with [`amplify sandbox secret`](/gen2/reference/cli-commands#amplify-sandbox-secret) for use with cloud sandbox, or via Amplify Console for branch environments.

</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth, secret } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalProviders: {
      google: {
        clientId: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      signInWithApple: {
        keyId: secret('SIWA_KEY_ID'),
        privateKey: secret('SIWA_PRIVATE_KEY'),
        teamId: secret('SIWA_TEAM_ID')
      },
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      facebook: {
        clientId: secret('FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET')
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com']
    }
  }
});
```

You need to now inform your social provider of the newly configured authentication resource and its OAuth redirect URI:

### Customizing scopes for retrieving user data from social providers

You can determine the pieces of data you want to retrieve from each social provider when setting them up in the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file using `scopes`.

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalAuthProviders: {
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        // highlight-next-line
        scopes: ['email']
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com']
    }
  }
});
```

### Attribute mapping

You can map which attributes are mapped between your social login provider and your users created in Cognito. We will be able to have the best level of protection for developers if we ensure that attribute mappings that would not work are called out by the type system.

<Callout>

If you specify an attribute in your authentication resource as required, and it is not allowed for your social providers, signing in with that social provider will cause an error.

</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    externalAuthProviders: {
      loginWithAmazon: {
        clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
        clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'),
        // highlight-start
        userAttributeMapping: {
          email: 'email'
        }
        // highlight-end
      },
      callbackUrls: [
        'http://localhost:3000/profile',
        'https://mywebsite.com/profile'
      ],
      logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000/', 'https://mywebsite.com']
    }
  }
});
```

## Set up your frontend

<Callout info>
If you are using the [Authenticator component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator/configuration#social-providers) with Amplify (Gen 2), this feature works without any additional code. The guide below is for writing your own implementation.
</Callout>

Enabling a signing in of a user with a social provider can be done as shown in the following code snippet.

```ts title="src/my-client-side-js.js"
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

try {
  const { user } = await Auth.signInWithWebUI({
    provider: 'google'
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log('error signing up:', error);
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Add social provider sign-in** guide. In this guide, you learned how to set up your social auth provider with Amplify. Your users can now sign into your app using their social provider accounts.

### Next steps
Now that you have social provider sign-in you may also want to learn additional ways to customize these workflows. We recommend you learn more about:
