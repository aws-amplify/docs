# Verifying user accounts

If you decide to use a `username` and password` login method for your users, you also have to provide a method to enable your users to verify their account after they sign up.

You can set up your verification to work either by having your users provide a code, or receive a link that they are redirected to for confirming their accounts.

By default, your users can verify their accounts by passing a code. The following are the default verification methods used when either `phone` or `email` are used as `loginWith` options.

| Login option        | User account verification channel |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `phone`             | Phone Number                      |
| `email`             | Email                             |
| `email` and `phone` | Email                             |

## Overriding the default user account verification channel

You can always change the channel used by your authentication resources by overriding the following setting.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { Backend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { AccountRecovery } from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';
import { auth } from './auth';
import { data } from './data';

const backend = new Backend({
  auth,
  data,
});

backend.resources.auth.resources.userPool.accountRecovery =
  AccountRecovery.EMAIL_ONLY;
```
