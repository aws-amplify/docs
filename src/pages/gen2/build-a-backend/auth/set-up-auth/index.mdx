In this guide, you will learn how to set up authentication in your Amplify (Gen 2) app. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources and enabling sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out with the Authenticator UI component. We will also provide more context on how resources are managed and created with Amplify to help you make decisions and understand any long-term impact of those decisions.

If you have not yet created an Amplify (Gen 2) app, visit the [quickstart](/gen2/start/quickstart).

## Building your auth backend

### Configure auth resource

To configure your auth backend, edit the `amplify/auth/resource.ts` file. You can set up sign-in mechanisms that work with either an email/phone and password combination, or through integration with social provider sign-in options.

<Accordion title='Understanding Auth high-level concepts' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

- _Authentication_ is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as _AuthN_). The system that does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
- _Authorization_ is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as _AuthZ_). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include:

- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties.

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by:

- Modifying the default password policy to ensure your users create stronger passwords.
- Requiring additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.

At a minimum, you will need to pass a `loginWith` value to set up how your users sign in to your app. Signing in with email and password is configured by default if you do not provide any value.

      // }
      // callbackUrls: ['http://localhost:3000'],
      // logoutUrls: ['http://localhost:3000'],
    }
  },
  /**
   * Enable multifactor authentication
   * @see https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa
   */
  // multifactor: {
  //   mode: 'OPTIONAL',
  //   sms: {
  //     smsMessage: (code) => `Your verification code is ${code}`,
  //   },
  // },
  userAttributes: {
    /** Request additional attributes for your app's users */
    // profilePicture: {
    //   mutable: true,
    //   required: false,
    // },
  }
});
```

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery, and other operations. If you have not worked with Amazon Cognito before, we recommend taking a closer look at Amazon Cognito configuration options before you continue, since some of them are irreversible after your resources are created.

<Accordion title='Review Amazon Cognito configuration options' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amazon Cognito can be customized based on your security strategy for authentication. However, some initial configuration options cannot be changed after the backend resources are configured:

- User attributes that are used to identify your individual users (such as username and email) cannot be renamed or deleted.
- Sign-in methods (including username, email, and phone) cannot be added or changed after the initial configuration. This includes both defining which attributes are used to sign in and which attributes are required. Required attributes must have a value for all users once set.
- Verification methods (including username and email) are the same as required attributes and cannot be removed once configured.
- The `sub` attribute is a unique identifier within each user pool that cannot be modified and can be used to index and search users.
- If MFA is set to **required** for all users, you will need to include MFA setup when users sign up.

See the [Amazon Cognito documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) for more details on these settings, including [User pool attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) and [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).

### Deploy auth resource

After you have chosen and set up your authentication resource, run the following command to create your first authentication resource in your personal cloud sandbox.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx amplify sandbox
```

After a successful deployment, this command also generates a configuration file (`amplifyconfiguration.json`) to enable your frontend app to connect to your backend resources. The values you configure in your backend authentication resource are set in the generated configuration file to automatically configure the frontend [`Authenticator connected component`](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator).

## Connect your application code to the auth backend

Creating and correctly implementing the sign-in flow can be challenging and time-consuming. Amplify's Authenticator UI component streamlines this by enabling you to rapidly build the entire authentication flow for your app. The component works seamlessly with configuration in `amplify/auth/resource.ts` to automatically connect with your backend resources.

Amplify has pre-built UI components for React, Vue, Angular, React Native, Swift, Android, and Flutter. In this guide, we are focusing on those for web applications.

<Block name="React">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-react` library:

```sh
npm add @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

Next, open **pages/\_app.ts** and add the `withAuthenticator` component.

**withAuthenticator**

A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns an enhanced component. The `withAuthenticator` HOC is an example of this pattern. It wraps the `Authenticator` component and enhances it by passing along additional authentication-related data like `user` info and the `signOut` function.

**Usage**

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts title="pages/_app.tsx"
// pages/_app.tsx
import { withAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import config from '@/amplifyconfiguration.json';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
import type { WithAuthenticatorProps } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

Amplify.configure(config);

function App({ Component, pageProps, signOut, user }: WithAuthenticatorProps) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello {user?.username}</h1>
      <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

```bash
npm add @aws-amplify/ui-vue
```

Next, open **src/App.vue** and add the `Authenticator` component.

**Authenticator**

The `Authenticator` component offers a simple way to add authentication flows into your app. This component encapsulates an authentication workflow in the framework of your choice and is backed by your backend Auth resources. `Authenticator` passes the `user` info and `signOut` function to the inner template.

```html
<script setup>
  import { Authenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-vue";
  import "@aws-amplify/ui-vue/styles.css";

  import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
  import config from '../amplifyconfiguration.json';

  Amplify.configure(config);
</script>

<template>
  <authenticator>
    <template v-slot="{ user, signOut }">
      <h1>Hello {{ user.username }}!</h1>
      <button @click="signOut">Sign Out</button>
    </template>
  </authenticator>
</template>
```

</Block>
<Block name="Vue 2">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-components` library:

```bash
npm add @aws-amplify/ui-components
```

Now open **src/main.js** and add the following below your last import:

```js
import '@aws-amplify/ui-components';
import {
  applyPolyfills,
  defineCustomElements
} from '@aws-amplify/ui-components/loader';
import Vue from 'vue';

Vue.config.ignoredElements = [/amplify-\w*/];

applyPolyfills().then(() => {
  defineCustomElements(window);
});
```

Next, open **src/App.js** and add the `amplify-authenticator` component.

**amplify-authenticator**

The `amplify-authenticator` component offers a simple way to add authentication flows into your app. This component encapsulates an authentication workflow in the framework of your choice and is backed by your backend Auth resources. The optional `amplify-sign-out` component is available if you would like to render a sign-out button.

```html
<template>
  <amplify-authenticator>
    <div>
      My App
      <amplify-sign-out></amplify-sign-out>
    </div>
  </amplify-authenticator>
</template>
```

</Block>
<Block name="Angular">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` library:

```bash
npm add @aws-amplify/ui-angular
```

Now open **app.module.ts** and add the Amplify imports and configuration:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AmplifyAuthenticatorModule } from '@aws-amplify/ui-angular';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import config from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(config);

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AmplifyAuthenticatorModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Next, import the default theme inside **styles.css**:

```css
@import '~@aws-amplify/ui-angular/theme.css';
```

Next, open **app.component.html** and add the `amplify-authenticator` component.

**amplify-authenticator**

Once you add the Authenticator component to your app, you can test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality. You can also [customize the Authenticator connected component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator/customization) to adjust colors and styling as needed.

## Manage users in the Amplify console

Once you deploy your code to Git, you can manage users and groups for the branch environment in the Amplify console.
