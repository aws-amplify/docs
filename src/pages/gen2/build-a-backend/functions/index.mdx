**Coming soon:** The Functions experience in Amplify (Gen 2) is still under development. Expect the API surface to change dramatically during the Gen 2 preview period. If you have any feedback on the desired developer experience, please [file a GitHub issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-backend/issues).

To use Functions today you must use the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/). To get started, install the CDK library package:

```bash
npm add --save-dev aws-cdk-lib
```

<Callout warning>

Depending on the Node.js package manager you are using, you may encounter warnings where it is now unable to resolve the peer dependency version `@aws-amplify/backend` has on `aws-cdk-lib`. If you encounter a warning similar to the following, re-install the version specified in the warning text:

```
npm WARN Could not resolve dependency:
npm WARN peer aws-cdk-lib@"~2.103.0" from @aws-amplify/backend@0.4.0
npm WARN node_modules/@aws-amplify/backend
npm WARN   dev @aws-amplify/backend@"^0.4.0" from the root project
```

Using the sample warning text above, you would need to install `aws-cdk-lib@2.103.0`.

## Example - Create a Function Trigger for Auth

You can use CDK's [`NodejsFunction` construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs.NodejsFunction.html) to create the Function definition, and apply to the Amplify-generated Amazon Cognito resource as a Cognito Trigger. This is made possible via the L2 [`UserPool` construct and its provided `.addTrigger()` method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.UserPool.html#addwbrtriggeroperation-fn).

First, create the trigger's shell of a Function handler by creating a file at `amplify/custom/post-confirmation.ts` with the following contents:

```ts title="amplify/custom/post-confirmation.ts"
import type { PostConfirmationTriggerHandler } from 'aws-lambda';

export const handler: PostConfirmationTriggerHandler = async (event) => {
  console.log('event: ', JSON.stringify(event));
};
```

Next, create the instance of `NodejsFunction` using the scaffolding below, and use the `.addTrigger()` method to set the Function on your Amazon Cognito resource.

{/* @TODO, remove type casting to cognito.UserPool once the interface -> class type is addressed */}

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import * as url from 'node:url';
import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs';
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

// create function stack for the auth triggers
const authTriggerStack = backend.getStack('AuthTriggerStack');

// create the PostConfirmation trigger
const postConfirmationTrigger = new lambda.NodejsFunction(
  authTriggerStack,
  'PostConfirmation',
  {
    entry: url.fileURLToPath(
      new URL('./custom/post-confirmation.ts', import.meta.url)
    )
  }
);

// add the newly-created trigger to the auth resource
const userPool = backend.resources.auth.resources.userPool as cognito.UserPool;
userPool.addTrigger(
  cognito.UserPoolOperation.POST_CONFIRMATION,
  postConfirmationTrigger
);
```
