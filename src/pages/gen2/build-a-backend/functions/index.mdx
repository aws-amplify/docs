<Callout info>

**Coming soon:** The Functions experience for Amplify (Gen 2) is still under development. You can add functions to your Gen-2 app with the [AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

</Callout>

To use Functions with the preview version of Amplify (Gen 2), you must use the AWS CDK. In the following sections, we walk through installing the CDK library package and building an example backend function using the CDK.

To get started, install the CDK library package:

```bash
npm add --save-dev aws-cdk-lib
```

<Callout warning>

Depending on the Node.js package manager you're using, you may encounter warnings where it is now unable to resolve the peer dependency version `@aws-amplify/backend` has on `aws-cdk-lib`. If you encounter a warning similar to the following, reinstall the version specified in the warning text:

```
npm WARN Could not resolve dependency:
npm WARN peer aws-cdk-lib@"~2.103.0" from @aws-amplify/backend@0.4.0
npm WARN node_modules/@aws-amplify/backend
npm WARN   dev @aws-amplify/backend@"^0.4.0" from the root project
```

Using the sample warning text above, you would need to install `aws-cdk-lib@2.103.0`.

</Callout>

## Example - Create a Function trigger for Auth

You can use the [`NodejsFunction` construct](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_lambda_nodejs.NodejsFunction.html) in the AWS CDK to create the Function definition, and apply it to the Amplify-generated Amazon Cognito resource as a Cognito trigger. This is made possible through the L2 [`UserPool` construct and its provided `.addTrigger()` method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_cognito.UserPool.html#addwbrtriggeroperation-fn).

First, create the trigger's shell of a Function handler by creating a file at `amplify/custom/post-confirmation.ts` with the following contents:

```ts title="amplify/custom/post-confirmation.ts"
// amplify/custom/post-confirmation.ts
import type { PostConfirmationTriggerHandler } from 'aws-lambda';

export const handler: PostConfirmationTriggerHandler = async (event) => {
  console.log('event: ', JSON.stringify(event));
};
```

Next, create the instance of `NodejsFunction` using the scaffolding below, and use the `.addTrigger()` method to set the Function on your Amazon Cognito resource.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
// amplify/backend.ts
import * as url from 'node:url';
import * as cognito from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-cognito';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda-nodejs';
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

// create function stack for the auth triggers
const authTriggerStack = backend.createStack('AuthTriggerStack');

// create the PostConfirmation trigger
const postConfirmationTrigger = new lambda.NodejsFunction(
  authTriggerStack,
  'PostConfirmation',
  {
    entry: url.fileURLToPath(
      new URL('./custom/post-confirmation.ts', import.meta.url)
    )
  }
);

// add the newly created trigger to the auth resource
const userPool = backend.auth.resources.userPool as cognito.UserPool;
userPool.addTrigger(
  cognito.UserPoolOperation.POST_CONFIRMATION,
  postConfirmationTrigger
);
```
