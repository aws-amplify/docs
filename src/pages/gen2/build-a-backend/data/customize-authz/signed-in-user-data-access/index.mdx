The `private` authorization strategy restricts record access to only signed-in users authenticated through IAM, Cognito, or OpenID Connect, applying the authorization rule to all users. It provides a simple way to make data private to all authenticated users.

## Add signed-in user authorization rule

You can use the `private` authorization strategy to restrict a record's access to every signed-in user.

**Note:** If you want to restrict a record's access to a specific user, see [Per-user/per-owner data access](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/per-user-per-owner-data-access/). The `private` authorization strategy detailed on this page applies the authorization rule for data access to **every** signed-in user.

In the example below, anyone with a valid JWT token from the Cognito user pool is allowed access to all Todos.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization([a.allow.private()]),
});
```

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using `client.models.<ModelName>` with the `userPool` auth mode.

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource'; // Path to your backend resource definition

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create(
  {
    content: 'My new todo',
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    authMode: 'userPool',
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

## Use identity pool for signed-in user authentication

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Unauthenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API key. Your Auth resources defined in `amplify/auth/resource.ts` generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Unauthenticated role" in the Cognito identity pool automatically.


```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
    })
    .authorization([a.allow.private('iam')]),
});
```

In your application, you can perform CRUD operations against the model using `client.models.<ModelName>` with the `iam` auth mode.

**Note**
In the Amplify Library's client configuration file (`amplifyconfiguration.json`) set `allowGuestAccess` to `true`. This lets the Amplify Library use the authenticated role from your Cognito identity pool when your user is logged in.

{
	"Auth": {
		"Cognito": {
			"userPoolId": "YOUR_USER_POOL_ID",

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import type { Schema } from '../amplify/data/resource'; // Path to your backend resource definition

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create(
  {
    content: 'My new todo',
  },
  // highlight-start
  {
    authMode: 'iam',
  }
  // highlight-end
);
```

In addition, you can also use OpenID Connect with `private` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider/).
