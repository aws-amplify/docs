The `private` authorization strategy restricts record access to only signed-in users authenticated through IAM, Cognito, or OpenID Connect, applying the authorization rule to all users. It provides a simple way to make data private to all authenticated users.

## Add signed-in user authorization rule

You can use the `private` authorization strategy to restrict a record's access to every signed-in user.

**Note:** If you want to restrict a record's access to a specific user, see [Per-user/per-owner data access](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/per-user-per-owner-data-access/). The `private` authorization strategy detailed on this page applies the authorization rule for data access to **every** signed-in user.

In the example below, anyone with a valid JWT token from the Cognito user pool is allowed access to all Todos.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.private()
  ])
})
```

## Override the authentication provider

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Unauthenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API key. Your Auth resources defined in `amplify/auth/resource.ts` generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Unauthenticated role" in the Cognito identity pool automatically.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.private("iam")
  ])
})
```

In addition, you can also use OpenID Connect with `private` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider/).
