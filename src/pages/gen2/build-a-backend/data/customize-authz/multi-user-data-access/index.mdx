The `multipleOwners` rule grants a set of users access to a record by automatically creating an `owners` field to store the allowed record owners. You can override the default owners field name by specifying `inField` with the desired field name to store the owner information. You can dynamically manage which users can access a record by updating the owner field.

## Add multi-user authorization rule

If you want to grant a set of users access to a record, you use the `multipleOwners` rule. This automatically creates a `owner: a.string().array()` field to store the allowed owners.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.multipleOwners()
  ])
})
```

## Override to a list of owners

You can override the `inField` to a list of owners. Use this if you want a dynamic set of users to have access to a record. In the example below, the `authors` list is populated with the creator of the record upon record creation. The creator can then update the `authors` field with additional users. Any user listed in the `authors` field can access the record.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
    authors: a.string().array() // record owner information now stored in "authors" field
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.multipleOwners().inField("authors")
  ])
})
```
