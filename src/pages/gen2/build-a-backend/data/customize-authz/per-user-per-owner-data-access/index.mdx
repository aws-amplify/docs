The `owner` authorization strategy restricts operations on a record to only the record's owner. When configured, the `owner` field will automatically be added and populated with the identity of the created user. The API will authorize against the `owner` field to allow or deny operations.

## Add per-user/per-owner authorization rule

You can use the `owner` authorization strategy to restrict a record's access to a specific user. When `owner` authorization is configured, only the record's `owner` is allowed the specified operations.

```ts
// The "owner" of a Todo is allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own todos
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.owner()
  ])
})
```

```ts
// The "owner" of a Todo record is only allowed to create, read, and update it.
// The "owner" of a Todo record is denied to delete it.
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.owner().to(["create", "read", "update"])
  ])
})
```

Behind the scenes, Amplify will automatically add a `owner: a.string()` field to each record which contains the record owner's identity information upon record creation.

By default, the Cognito user pool's user information is populated into the `owner` field. The value saved includes `sub` and `username` in the format `<sub>::<username>`. The API will authorize against the full value of `<sub>::<username>` or `sub` / `username` separately and return `username`. You can alternatively configure [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider).

<Callout warning>

**By default, owners can reassign the owner of their existing record to another user.**

To prevent an owner from reassigning their record to another user, protect the owner field (by default `owner: String`) with a [field-level authorization rule](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/#field-level-authorization-rules). For example, in a social media app, you would want to prevent Alice from being able to reassign Alice's Post to Bob.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
    owner: a.string().authorization([a.allow.owner().to(["read", "delete"])])
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.owner()
  ])
})
```

</Callout>

## Customize the owner field

You can override the `owner` field to your own preferred field, by specifying a custom `ownerField` in the authorization rule.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
    author: a.string() // record owner information now stored in "author" field
  }).authorization([
    a.allow.owner().inField("author")
  ])
})
```
