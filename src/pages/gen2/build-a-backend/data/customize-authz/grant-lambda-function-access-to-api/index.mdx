The IAM execution role for Lambda functions does not automatically grant access to the Amplify Data API. This is because the API operates on a "deny-by-default" permission model. Access must be explicitly granted.

To grant an external AWS resource or an IAM role access to the Amplify Data API, you need to explicitly list the IAM roles by adding them to `allowListedRoleNames` property.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// amplify/data/resource.ts
import { a, defineData, type ClientSchema } from "@aws-amplify/backend";

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    description: a.string(),
  }),
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    // Pass in the Lambda Execution Role names to grant full read/write access to the API
    // if their IAM policies permit it.
    allowListedRoleNames: ["lambdaRole"],
  },
});
```

These "Allow-listed Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their [IAM policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#aws-iam-authorization) instead of any particular `.authorization()` rule.
