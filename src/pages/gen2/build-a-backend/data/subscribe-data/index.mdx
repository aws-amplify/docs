# Customize real-time subscriptions

### Change subscription access-level
By default, real-time updates are on for all `a.model()`, which means customers receive real-time updates if their authorization rules allows it. You can also turn off subscriptions for that model or make the real-time updates public, receivable by all subscribers.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).subscriptionAccessLevel("off") // Allowed values are "on" (default), "public", "off"
})
```

> Note: If the access level is set to "off", then the client code won't have `onCreate`, `onUpdate`, `onDelete`, or `observeQuery` operations on the model. For example, with the above schema, this is not valid.

```ts
client.models.Todo.onCreate() // <-- NOT VALID
```


### Rename generated queries, mutations, and subscriptions

You can override the names of any `a.model(...)`'s underlying GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions by supplying the desired name. TK: This does not affect your TypeScript's client code but is a helpful syntactic sugar for non-TypeScript clients that rely on GraphQL code generation.

```ts
export const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a.model({
    content: a.string()
  }).renameOperations({
    "onCreate": "onAdd",
    "onUpdate": "onModified"
    "onDelete": "onRemove"
  })
})
```
