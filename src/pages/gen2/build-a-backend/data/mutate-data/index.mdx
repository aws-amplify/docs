In this guide, you will learn how to create, update, and delete your data using Amplify Libraries' Data client.

Before you begin, you will need:

- An [application connected to the API](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/connect-to-API/)

## Create an item

You can create an item by first generating the Data client with your backend Data schema. Then you can add an item:

```js
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import { type Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource'

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create({
  content: "My new todo",
  done: true,
})
```

<Callout>

**Note:** You do not need to specify `createdAt` or `updatedAt` fields because Amplify automatically populates these fields for you.

</Callout>

## Update an item

To update the item, use the `update` function:

```js
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import { type Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource'

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const todoDetails = {
  id: 'some_id',
  description: 'Updated description'
};

const { data: updatedTodo, errors } = await client.models.Todo.update(todo)
```

<Callout>

**Notes:**

- You do not need to specify the `updatedAt` field. Amplify will automatically populate this field for you.
- If you specify _extra_ input fields not expected by the API, this query will fail. You can see this in the `errors` field returned by the query. With Amplify Data, errors are not thrown like exceptions. Instead, any errors are captured and returned as part of the query result in the `errors` field.

</Callout>

## Delete an item

You can then delete the Todo by using the delete mutation. To specify which item to delete, you only need to provide the `id` of that item:

```js
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import { type Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource'

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const toBeDeletedTodo = {
  id: "123123213"
}

const { data: deletedTodo, errors } = await client.models.Todo.delete(toBeDeletedTodo)
```

<Callout>

**Note:** When deleting items in many-to-many relationships, the join table records must be deleted before deleting the associated records. For example, for a many-to-many relationship between Posts and Tags, delete the PostTags join record before deleting a Post or Tag. Review [Many-to-many relationships](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/data-modeling/relationships/) for more details.

<Accordion title='Troubleshoot unauthorized errors' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Troubleshooting'>

Each API request uses an authorization mode. If you get unauthorized errors, you may need to update your authorization mode. To override the default authorization mode defined in your **amplify/data/resource.ts** file, pass an `authMode` property to the request or the client. The following examples show how you can mutate data with a custom authorization mode:

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/data';
import { type Schema } from '@/amplify/data/resource';

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { errors, data: newTodo } = await client.models.Todo.create(
  {
    content: 'My new todo',
    done: true
  },
  {
    authMode: 'apiKey'
  }
);
```

</Accordion>

## Cancel create, update, and delete requests

You can cancel any mutation API request by calling `.cancel` on the mutation request promise that's returned by `.create(...)`, `.update(...)`, or `.delete(...)`.

```javascript
const promise = client.models.Todo.create({ content: "New Todo "})
            //  ^ Note: we're not awaiting the request, we're returning the promise

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (client.isCancelError(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
client.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `.create()`, `.update()`, and `.delete()` has not been modified. Typically, async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will **not** work:

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return client.models.Todo.create({ content: 'New Todo' });
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
client.cancel(promise, 'my error message');
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the **Create, update, and delete application data** guide. In this guide, you created, updated, and deleted your app data.

### Next steps

Our recommended next steps include using the API to query data and subscribe to real-time events to look for mutations in your data. Some resources that will help with this work include:

- [Read application data](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/query-data/)
- [Subscribe to real-time events](/gen2/build-a-backend/data/subscribe-data/)
