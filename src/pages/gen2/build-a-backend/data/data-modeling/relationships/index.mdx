Applications that work with data need to define the entities that represent said data. Entities are typically stored across different tables in a database, and items in a given table need a way to be **uniquely identified**. This is achieved by defining a field (or a combination of fields) that will hold a value (or values) to unambiguously refer to the item. When modeling applications, there is often the need to **establish relationships** between the entities. These relationships are achieved by having a fields that hold the value of the unique identifier of the related entity.

Sometimes when retrieving data for a given entity, retrieving its relationships too can be an expensive operation; for this reason it is important to offer a mechanism for consumers to specify if relationships should be  lazily or eagerly retrieved. Amplify Data provides a mechanism to do this with a "custom selection set" feature.

## Types of relationships

|Relationship|Description|
|------------|--------|
|`a.hasMany()`|Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models. For example, a Post has many comments. This allows you to query all the comments from the post record.|
|`a.manyToMany()`| Creates a bi-directional relationship, it needs to be defined on both related models. For example, a Blog has many Tags and a Tag has many Blogs.|
|`a.hasOne()`|Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models. For example, a Project "has one" Team. This allows you to query the team from the project record.|
|`a.belongsTo()`|Use a "belongs to" relationship to make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional. This bi-directionality only facilitates your ability to read from both sides of the relationship. For example, a Project has one Team and a Team belongs to a Project. This allows you to reference the team from the project record and vice versa.|

## Model a "Has Many" relationship

Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models using the `hasMany()` method.

In the example below, a Post has many Comments.

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string(),
    comments: a.hasMany('Comment')
  }),
  Comment: a.model({
    content: a.string(),
  }),
});
```

### Create a "Has Many" relationship between records

```ts
const { data: team } = await client.models.Team.create({
  mantra: "Hello"
})

await client.models.Member.update({
  id: "SOME_MEMBER_ID",
  team
})
```

### Update a "Has Many" relationship between records

```ts
await client.models.Member.update({
  id: "SOME_MEMBER_ID",
  team
})
```

### Delete a "Has Many" relationship between records

```ts
await client.models.Member.update({
  id: "SOME_MEMBER_ID",
  team: undefined
})
```

### Lazy load a "Has Many" relationships

```ts
const { data: team } = await client.models.Team.get({ id: "MY_TEAM_ID"})

const { data: members } = await team.members()

members.forEach(member => console.log(member.id))
```

### Eagerly load a "Has Many" relationships

```ts
const { data: teamWithMembers } = await client.models.Team.get({
  id: "MY_TEAM_ID"
  }, {
  selectionSet: ["id", "members.*"]
})

teamWithMembers.members.forEach(member => console.log(member.id))
```

## Model a "Many-to-many" relationship
Create a many-to-many relationship between two models with the `manyToMany()` method. Provide a common `relationName` on both models to join them into a many-to-many relationship. 

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string(),
    content: a.string(),
    tags: a.manyToMany('Tag', { relationName: 'PostTags'})
  }),
  Tag: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    posts: a.manyToMany('Post', { relationName: 'PostTags'})
  }),
});
```

## Model a "Has One" relationship

Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models using the `hasOne()` method.

In the example below, a Project has a Team.

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Project: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    team: a.hasOne('Team')
  }),
  Team: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
  }),
});
```
By using `hasOne` this way, it will automatically generate a field to hold the identifier of the related model.

### Create a "Has One" relationship between records

To create a "has one" relationship between records, first create the parent item then create the child item and assign the parent. 

```ts
TK
```

### Update a "Has One" relationship between records

To update a "Has One" relationship between records, you first have to get the child item, then set the reference to the parent to another parent.

```ts
TK
```

### Delete a "Has One" relationship between records

To delete a "Has One" relationship between records, you first have to unlink 

### Lazy load a "Has One" relationships

### Eagerly load a "Has One" relationships

### Model multiple relationships between two models

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Employee: a.model({
    firstName: a.string(),
    lastName: a.string(),
  }),
  Organization: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    individualContributors: a.hasMany('Employee'),
    managers: a.hasMany('Employee'),
  }),
});
```

```ts
const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { data: org } = await client.models.Organization.get('AE6191BF-FEB4-4D8B-867D-898A7DA33101');

const { data: ics } = await org.individualContributors();
const { data: managers } = await org.managers();
```


## Model a bi-directional relationship

Make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional with the `belongsTo()` method. The bi-directionality of `belongsTo()` grants you the ability to query the related item from both sides of the relationship. 

> Note: The `belongsTo()` method requires that a `hasOne()` or `hasMany()` relationship already exists from parent to the related model.

### Bi-directional Has One relationship

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Project: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    team: a.hasOne('Team')
  }),
  Team: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    project: a.belongsTo('Project'),
  }),
});
```

```ts
const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { data: team } = await client.models.Team.get('FABF27EE-25D2-4851-AE1C-09BCA1604C77');

console.log((await team.project()).name); // There is a 'project' field in the team

(await team.project()).team === team; // Navigating back to the team from the project
```

"Belongs to"-relationships **does not** allow you to update both sides of a "has one" and "belongs to" relationship in a transactional nature.

### Bi-directional Has Many relationship

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string(),
    comments: a.hasMany('Comment'),
  }),
  Comment: a.model({
    content: a.string(),
    post: a.belongsTo('Post'),
  }),
});
```

```ts
const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { data: post } = await client.models.Post.get('FABF27EE-25D2-4851-AE1C-09BCA1604C77');

(await post.comments())[0].post === post; // Navigating back to the post from the comment
```

### Relationships to a model with a composite identifier

TK: stored in a single field with a separator? e.g. `manger.branch = 'TENANT123>Downtown'`

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  StoreBranch: a.model({
    tenantId: a.string(),
    name: a.string(),
    country: a.string(),
    state: a.string(),
    city: a.string(),
    zipCode: a.string(),
    streetAddress: a.string(),
  }).identifier(['tenantId', 'name'])
});
```

## Retrieving related models

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Project: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    team: a.hasOne('Team'),
  }),
  Team: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
  }),
});

const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { data: project } = await client.models.Project.get('1234');
project.name;
(await project.team).name // project.team is typed as `Lazy<Team>` and can be awaited

const projectWithTeam = await client.models.Project.get('1234', ['team.*']);
project.team.name // All team attributes were requested, so no need to await, it was eagerly loaded
```

## Manipulating relationships

NO CASCADING BEHAVIOR
- Save in the right order (e.g. parent before children)
- What about bi-directionality then? chicken and egg situation

```typescript
client.Models.Project
```
