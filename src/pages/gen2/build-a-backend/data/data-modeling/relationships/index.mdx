When modeling application data, you often need to establish relationships between different data models. In Amplify Data, you can create one-to-many, one-to-one, and many-to-many relationships in your Data schema. On the client-side, Amplify Data allows you to lazy or eager load of related data.

 ## Types of relationships

|Relationship|Code|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|-|
|one to many|`a.hasMany(...)` & `a.belongsTo(...)`|Creates a one-to-many relationship between two models.|A **Team** has many **Members**. A **Member** belongs to a **Team**.|
|one to one|`a.hasOne(...)` & `a.belongsTo(...)`|Creates a one-to-one relationship between two models.|A **Customer** has one **Cart**. A **Cart** belongs to one **Customer**.|
|many to many| Two `a.hasMany(...)` & `a.belongsTo(...)` on join tables|Create two one-to-many relationships between the related models in a join table.|A **Post** has many **Tags**. A **Tag** has many **Posts**.|

## Model one-to-many relationships

Create a one-to-many relationship between two models using the `hasMany()` and `belongsTo()` method. In the example below, a Team has many Members and a Member belongs to exactly one Team.

1. Create a **reference field** called `teamId` on the **Member** model. This reference field's type **MUST** match the type of **Team**'s identifier. In this case, it's an auto-generated `id: a.id().required()` field.
2. Add a **relationship field** called `team` that references the `teamId` field. This allows you to query for the team information from the **Member** model. 
3. Add a **relationship field** called `members` that references the `teamId` field on the **Member** model.

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Member: a.model({
    name: a.string().required(),
    // 1. Create a reference field
    teamId: a.id(),
    // 2. Create a belongsTo relationship with the reference field
    team: a.belongsTo('Team', 'teamId'),
  })
  .authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]),

  Team: a.model({
    mantra: a.string().required(),
    // 3. Create a hasMany relationship with the reference field 
    //    from the `Member`s model.
    members: a.hasMany('Member', 'teamId'),
  })
  .authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]),
});
```

### Create a "Has Many" relationship between records

```ts
const { data: team } = await client.models.Team.create({
  mantra: 'Go Frontend!',
});

const { data: member } = await client.models.Member.create({
  name: "Tim",
  team,
});
```

### Update a "Has Many" relationship between records

```ts
const { data: newTeam } = await client.models.Team.create({
  mantra: 'Go Fullstack',
});

await client.models.Member.update({
  id: member.id,
  team,
});
```

### Delete a "Has Many" relationship between records

If your reference field is not required, then you can "delete" a one-to-many relationship by setting the relationship value to `null`. 

```ts
await client.models.Member.update({
  id: 'SOME_MEMBER_ID',
  team: null,
});
```

### Lazy load a "Has Many" relationship

```ts
const { data: team } = await client.models.Team.get({ id: "MY_TEAM_ID"});

const { data: members } = await team.members();

members.forEach(member => console.log(member.id));
```

### Eagerly load a "Has Many" relationship

```ts
const { data: teamWithMembers } = await client.models.Team.get(
  { id: "MY_TEAM_ID" },
  { selectionSet: ["id", "members.*"] },
);

teamWithMembers.members.forEach(member => console.log(member.id));
```

## Model a "one-to-one" relationship

Create a one-to-one relationship between two models using the `hasOne()` and `belongsTo()` methods. In the example below, a **Customer** has a **Cart** and a *Cart* belongs to a **Customer**. 

1. Create a **reference field** called `customerId` on the **Cart** model. This reference field's type **MUST** match the type of **Customer**'s identifier. In this case, it's an auto-generated `id: a.id().required()` field.
2. Add a **relationship field** called `customer` that references the `customerId` field. This allows you to query for the customer information from the **Cart** model. 
3. Add a **relationship field** called `activeCart` that references the `customerId` field on the **Cart** model.

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Cart: a.model({
    items: a.string().required().array(),
    // 1. Create reference field
    customerId: a.id(),
    // 2. Create relationship field with the reference field
    customer: a.belongsTo('Customer', 'customerId'),
  }),
  Customer: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    // 3. Create relationship field with the reference field
    //    from the Cart model
    activeCart: a.hasOne('Cart', 'customerId')
  }),
});
```

### Create a "Has One" relationship between records

To create a "has one" relationship between records, first create the parent item and then create the child item and assign the parent. 

```ts
const { data: customer } = await client.models.Customer.create({
  name: 'Rene',
});

const { data: cart } = await client.models.Cart.create({
  items: ['Tomato', 'Ice', 'Mint'],
  customer,
});
```

### Update a "Has One" relationship between records

To update a "Has One" relationship between records, you first retrieve the child item and then update the reference to the parent to another parent. For example, to reassign a Cart to another Customer:

```ts
const { data: newCustomer } = await client.models.Customer.create({
  name: 'Ian',
});

await client.models.Cart.update({
  id: cart.id,
  customer: newCustomer,
});
```

### Delete a "Has One" relationship between records

You can the relationship field to `null` to delete a "Has One" relationship between records.

```ts
await client.models.Cart.update({
  id: project.id,
  customer: null,
});
```

### Lazy load a "Has One" relationship

```ts
const { data: cart } = await client.models.Cart.get({ id: "MY_CART_ID"});
const { data: customer } = await cart.customer();
```

### Eagerly load a "Has One" relationship

```ts
const { data: cart } = await client.models.Cart.get(
  { id: "MY_CART_ID" },
  { selectionSet: ['id', 'customer.*'] },
);

console.log(cart.customer.id)
```

## Model a "many-to-many" relationship
Create a many-to-many relationship between two models, you have to create a model that serves as a "join table". This "join table" should contain two one-to-many relationships between the two related entity. For example, to model a **Post** has many **Tags** and a **Tag** has many **Posts**, you'll need to create a new **PostTag** model that represents the relationship between these two entities.

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  PostTag: a.model({
    // 1. Create reference fields to both ends of 
    //    the many-to-many relationship
    // highlight-start
    postId: a.id().required(),
    tagId: a.id().required(),
    // highlight-end
    // 2. Create relationship fields to both ends of
    //    the many-to-many relationship using their
    //    respective reference fields
    // highlight-start
    post: a.belongsTo('Post', 'postId'),
    tag: a.belongsTo('Tag', 'tagId'),
    // highlight-end
  }),
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string(),
    content: a.string(),
    // 3. Add relationship field to the join model
    //    with the reference of `postId`
    // highlight-next-line
    tags: a.hasMany('PostTag', 'postId'),
  }),
  Tag: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    // 4. Add relationship field to the join model
    //    with the reference of `tagId`
    // highlight-next-line
    posts: a.hasMany('PostTag', 'tagId'),
  }),
}).authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]);
```

## Model multiple relationships between two models

Relationships are defined uniquely by their reference fields. For example, a Post can have two relationships to a Person model for `author` and `editor`. 

```typescript
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string().required(),  
    content: a.string().required(),  
    // highlight-start
    authorId: a.id(),
    author: a.belongsTo('Person', 'authorId'),
    editorId: a.id(),
    editor: a.belongsTo('Person', 'editorId'),
    // highlight-end
  }),
  Person: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    // highlight-start
    editedPosts: a.hasMany('Post', 'editorId'),
    authoredPosts: a.hasMany('Post', 'authorId'),
    // highlight-end
  }),
}).authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]);
```

On the client-side, you can fetch the related data with the following code:

```ts
const client = generateClient<Schema>();

const { data: post } = await client.models.Post.get({ id: 'SOME_POST_ID' });

const { data: authors } = await post.authors();
const { data: editors } = await post.editors();
```

## Model relationships for models with sort keys in their identifier

In case your data model uses sort keys in the identifier, you need to also add in reference fields store the sort key fields in the related data model:

```ts
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
    title: a.string().required(),  
    content: a.string().required(),  
    // Reference fields must correspond to identifier fields.
    // highlight-start
    authorName: a.string(),
    authorDoB: a.date(),
    // Must pass references in the same order as identifiers.
    author: a.belongsTo('Person', ['authorName', 'authorDoB']),
    // highlight-end
  }),
  Person: a.model({
    name: a.string().required(),
    dateOfBirth: a.date().required(),
    // Must reference all reference fields corresponding to the 
    // identifier of this model.
    authoredPosts: a.hasMany('Post', ['authorName', 'authorDoB']),
    // highlight-next-line
  }).identifier(['name', 'dateOfBirth']),
}).authorization(allow => [allow.publicApiKey()]);
```

## Make relationships required or optional

Amplify Data's relationship uses the reference fields to determine if a relationship is required or not. If you mark a reference field as required, then you can't "delete" a relationship between two models. You'd have to delete the related record as a whole.

```ts
const schema = a.schema({
  Post: a.model({
   
    title: a.string().required(),  
    content: a.string().required(),  
    // You must supply an author when creating the post
    // Author can't be set to `null`.
    // highlight-next-line
    authorId: a.id().required(),
    author: a.belongsTo('Person', 'authorId'),
    // You can optionally supply an editor when creating the post.
    // Editor can also be set to `null`.
    // highlight-next-line
    editorId: a.id(),
    editor: a.belongsTo('Person', 'editorId'),
  }),
  Person: a.model({
    name: a.string(),
    // highlight-start
    editedPosts: a.hasMany('Post', 'editorId'),
    authoredPosts: a.hasMany('Post', 'authorId'),
    // highlight-end
  }),
})
```
