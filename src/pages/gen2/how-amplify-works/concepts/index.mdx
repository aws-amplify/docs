The vNext AWS Amplify experience carries a few concepts from the "classic" experience, including the following categories:

- Auth
- Data (GraphQL API)
- Storage

It also maintains the concept of an Amplify "backend", but backend environments are now tied to a git branch.

## Design principles

1. Well-defined interfaces
1. Minimal footprint
1. Zero-config
1. Safe deployments
1. Fast local iteration
1. Extensible
