Use the following commands to completely remove Amplify CLI from your system. Removing the Amplify CLI will NOT delete any of your Amplify projects.
To delete a project, run `amplify delete` within the project directory.

If you installed the CLI using NPM, run:
```bash
npm uninstall -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

If you installed the CLI using the binary install script, run:
```bash
amplify uninstall
```
