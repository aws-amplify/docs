The Amplify CLI provides escape hatches for modifying the backend configurations generated in the form of CloudFormation templates by the CLI.

## How to extend Amplify CLI

The most common scenarios for extending your app beyond Amplify CLI's features are to:

- customize your GraphQL API business logic by [overriding resolvers](/cli/graphql-transformer/resolvers#overwriting-resolvers) or author your own [custom resolvers](/cli/graphql-transformer/resolvers#custom-resolvers).
- update the base configuration of an Amplify generated resource. Override Amplify CLI's generated CloudFormation by editing `amplify/backend/<category>/<cloudformation-template.json/yml>`. [Read more about Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
- add custom AWS resources that are not supported by the Amplify CLI currently, follow the steps below.

## Add custom AWS resources

Leverage CloudFormation to add an AWS resource to your Amplify project that isn't supported out-of-the-box. Amplify is partitioned into "categories" of use cases like `auth` or `function`. To add a custom stack, create a custom "category" and assign custom "resources" to it.

### 1. Configure backend configuration with custom resource

Modify `amplify/backend/backend-config.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "<custom-category-name>": {
    "<custom-resource-name>": {
      "service": <custom-aws-service-name>,
      "providerPlugin": "awscloudformation"
    }
  },
  "hosting": {
    "S3AndCloudFront": {
      "service": "S3AndCloudFront",
      "providerPlugin": "awscloudformation"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Modify folder structure for custom resource

Under `amplify/backend` folder, make a folder structure like the following:

```console
amplify
  \backend
    \<custom-category-name>
      \<custom-resource-name>
        parameters.json
        template.json
    \hosting
      parameters.json
      template.json
```

`template.json` is a CloudFormation template, and `parameters.json` is parameters file that will be passed to the cloudformation template. Additionally, the `env` parameter will be passed in to your CloudFormation templates dynamically by the CLI.

> **Note:** If you have multiple resources in the same category, the CloudFormation template files names must be unique but still contain `template`. For example: `template_<your_resource>.json` or `<your_resource>_template.yaml`.

### 3. (Optional) Reference existing parameters

Reference an output value from any other Amplify-managed category CloudFormation stack. For example, if you want to use `auth` category generated Amazon Cognito `UserPoolId` in your custom CloudFormation stack, you would need to add the `dependsOn` block in the `backend-config.json` file. The above `backend-config.json` file would look like the following:

```json
{
  "<custom-category-name>": {
    "<custom-resource-name>": {
      "service": <custom-aws-service-name>,
      "providerPlugin": "awscloudformation",
      "dependsOn": [
        {
          "category": "auth",
          "resourceName": "mycognitoresource", // check `amplify status` to find resource name
          "attributes": [
              "UserPoolId" // Check Output Value of the resource specific cloudformation file to find available attributes
            ]
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "hosting": {
    "S3AndCloudFront": {
      "service": "S3AndCloudFront",
      "providerPlugin": "awscloudformation"
    }
  }
}
```

Construct the following input parameter in your custom CloudFormation stack's `template.json` file to use the `UserPoolId` from the `auth` category. Amplify CLI passes this input automatically from the other nested stack.

```js
"Parameters": {
  // ... Rest of the parameters

  // The format out here is `<category><resource-name><attribute-name>`
  // we have defined all of these in the `backend-config.json` file above
  "authmycognitoresourceUserPoolId": {
    "Type": "String"
  }
},
```

Place one parameter in `parameters.json` named `authmycognitoresourceUserPoolId` with a CloudFormation `Fn::GetAtt` that connects the output of one nested template to your custom template.

```json
{
  // The format out here is `<category><resource-name><attribute-name>`
  // We have defined all of these in the `backend-config.json` file above
  "authmycognitoresourceUserPoolId": {
    "Fn::GetAtt": [
      // Reference the auth resource with this format <category><resource-name>
      "authmycognitoresource",
      "Outputs.UserPoolId"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Enable custom resources

Run `amplify env checkout <current-env-name>` to populate the CLI runtime files and make it aware of the newly added custom resources
