  title: `Override Amplify-generated S3 and DynamoDB resources`,
  description: 'The "amplify override storage" command generates a developer-configurable "overrides" TypeScript file which provides Amplify-generated S3 and DynamoDB resources as CDK constructs. For example, developers can run the “amplify override storage” command to enable Transfer Acceleration for Amplify-generated S3 buckets.',
};

```bash
amplify override storage
```

Run the command above to override Amplify-generated storage resources including the S3 bucket, DynamoDB tables, and more.

The command creates a new `overrides.ts` file under `amplify/backend/storage/<resource-name>/` which provides you the Amplify-generated resources as [CDK constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

## Customize Amplify-generated S3 resources

Apply all the overrides in the `override(...)` function. For example to enable versioning on your S3 bucket:
```ts
import { AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate } from '@aws-amplify/cli-extensibility-helper';

export function override(resources: AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate) {
  resources.s3Bucket.versioningConfiguration = {
    status: "Enabled"
  }
}
```

You can override the following S3-related resources that Amplify generates:

|Amplify-generated resource|Description|
|-|-|
|[s3Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-bucket.html)|The S3 bucket that Amplify generates for file storage upon `amplify add storage`|
|[s3AuthPublicPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for authenticated users' write access to `public/*` prefix|
|[s3AuthProtectedPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for authenticated users' write access to `protected/*` prefix|
|[s3AuthPrivatePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for authenticated users' write access to `private/*` prefix|
|[s3AuthUploadPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for authenticated users' write access to `uploads/*` prefix|
|[s3AuthReadPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for authenticated users' read access|
|[s3GuestPublicPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for guest users' write access to `public/*` prefix|
|[s3GuestUploadPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for guest users' write access to `uploads/*` prefix|
|[s3GuestReadPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|The IAM policy for guest users' read access|

## Customize Amplify-generated DynamoDB tables

Apply all the overrides in the `override(...)` function. For example to enable time-to-live specification on your DynamoDB table:
```ts
import { AmplifyDDBResourceTemplate } from '@aws-amplify/cli-extensibility-helper';

export function override(resources: AmplifyDDBResourceTemplate) {
  resources.dynamoDBTable.timeToLiveSpecification = {
    attributeName: "ttl",
    enabled: true
  }
}
```

You can override the following DynamoDB resources that Amplify generates:

|Amplify-generated resource|Description|
|-|-|
|[dynamoDBTable](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-dynamodb-table.html)|The DynamoDB table that Amplify creates upon `amplify add storage`|

## Accessing Amplify-generated values

Override function can be used to get access to Amplify-generated values. E.g. to add a new notification rule for Lambda Trigger function defined using CLI, we need to access the ARN of the function:

```ts
import { AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate } from '@aws-amplify/cli-extensibility-helper';
import * as s3 from '@aws-cdk/aws-s3';

export function override(resources: AmplifyS3ResourceTemplate) {
    const currentSettings  = resources.s3Bucket.notificationConfiguration as s3.CfnBucket.NotificationConfigurationProperty;
    const previousLambdaConfig  = currentSettings.lambdaConfigurations as s3.CfnBucket.LambdaConfigurationProperty[];
    const functionArn = currentSettings.lambdaConfigurations[0].function;
    const newConfig = {
        event: "s3:ObjectCreated:*",
        filter:{
            s3Key:{
                rules:[
                    {
                        name: "prefix",
                        value: "additionalPrefix/"
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        function: functionArn
    } as s3.CfnBucket.LambdaConfigurationProperty;
    // here we append custom config with amplify generated config
    previousLambdaConfig.push(newConfig);
    const notificationConfigurationProperty: s3.CfnBucket.NotificationConfigurationProperty = {
        lambdaConfigurations: previousLambdaConfig
    };

    resources.s3Bucket.notificationConfiguration = notificationConfigurationProperty;
}
```
