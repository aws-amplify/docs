Amplify automatically creates Amazon DynamoDB database tables for GraphQL types annotated with the `@model` directive in your GraphQL schema. You can create relations between the data models via the `@hasOne`, `@hasMany`, `@belongsTo`, and `@manyToMany` directives.

## Setup database tables

The following GraphQL schema automatically creates a database table for "Todo". `@model` will also automatically add an `id` field as a primary key to the database table. *See [Configure a primary key](#configure-a-primary-key) to learn how to customize the primary key.*

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  content: String
}
```

The Amplify CLI generates the Todo database table upon `amplify push` and generates a GraphQL API to perform create, read, update, delete, and list operations for the Todo model.

In addition, `@model` also adds the helper fields `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to your type. The values for those fields are read-only by clients unless explicitly overwritten. See [Customize creation and update timestamps](#customize-creation-and-update-timestamps) to learn more.

Try listing all the todos by executing the following query:
```graphql
query QueryAllTodos {
  listTodos() {
    todos {
      items {
        id
        content
        createdAt
        updatedAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure a primary key

Every GraphQL type with the `@model` directive will automatically have an `id` field set as the primary key. You can override this behavior by marking another required field with the `@primaryKey` directive. 

In the example below, `todoId` is the database's primary key and an `id` field will no longer be created automatically anymore by the `@model` directive.
```graphql
type Todo @model {
  todoId: ID! @primaryKey
  content: String
}
```

Without any further configuration, you'll only be able to query for a Todo via an exact equality match of its primary key field. In the example above, this is the `todoId` field.

> Note: After a primary key is configured and deployed, you can't change it without deleting and recreating your database table.

You can also specify "sort keys" to use a combination of different fields as a primary key. This also allows you to apply more advanced sorting and filtering conditions on the specified "sort key fields".

```graphql
type Inventory @model {
  productID: ID! @primaryKey(sortKeyFields: ["warehouseID"])
  warehouseID: ID!
  InventoryAmount: Int!
}
```

The schema above will allow you to pass different conditions to query the correct inventory item:
```graphql
query QueryInventoryByProductAndWarehouse($productID: ID!, $warehouseID: ID!) {
  getInventory(productID: $productID, warehouseID: $warehouseID) {
    productID
    warehouseID
    inventoryAmount
  }
}
```

### Configure a secondary index

Amplify uses Amazon DynamoDB tables as the underlying data source for @model types. For key-value databases, it is critical to model your access patterns with "secondary indexes". Use the `@index` directive to configure a secondary index. 

> **Amazon DynamoDB** is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale but making it work for your access patterns requires a bit of forethought. DynamoDB query operations may use at most two attributes to efficiently query data. The first query argument passed to a query (the hash key) must use strict equality and the second attribute (the sort key) may use gt, ge, lt, le, eq, beginsWith, and between. DynamoDB can effectively implement a wide variety of access patterns that are powerful enough for the majority of applications.

A secondary index consists of a "hash key" and, optionally, a "sort key". Use the "hash key" to perform strict equality and the "sort key" for greater than (gt), greater than or equal to (ge), less than (lt), less than or equal to (le), equals (eq), begins with, and between operations. 

```graphql
type Customer @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  phoneNumber: String
  accountRepresentativeID: ID! @index(name: "byRepresentative", queryField: "customerByRepresentative")
}
```

The example client query below allows you to query for "Customer" based on their `accountRepresentativeID`:

```graphql
query QueryCustomersForAccountRepresentative($representativeId: ID!) {
  customerByRepresentative(accountRepresentativeID: $representativeId) {
    customers {
      items {
        id
        name
        phoneNumber
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To optionally configure sort keys, provide the additional fields in the `sortKeyFields` parameter:

```graphql
type Customer @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String! @index(name: "byNameAndPhoneNumber", sortKeyFields: ["phoneNumber"], queryField: "customerByNameAndPhone")
  phoneNumber: String
  accountRepresentativeID: ID! @index(name: "byRepresentative", queryField: "customerByRepresentative")
}
```

The example client query below allows you to query for "Customer" based on their `name` and filter based on `phoneNumber`:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  customerByNameAndPhone(phoneNumber: {beginsWith: "+1"}, name: "Rene") {
    items {
      id
      name
      phoneNumber
    }
  }
}
```

## Setup relationships between models

Create "has one", "has many", "belongs to", and "many to many" relationships between `@model` types.

|Relationship|Description|
|------------|--------|
|`@hasOne`|Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models. For example, a Project "has one" Team. This allows you to query the team from the project record.
|`@hasMany`|Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models. For example, a Post has many comments. This allows you to query all the comments from the post record.
|`@belongsTo`|Use a "belongs to" relationship to make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional. For example, a Project has one Team and a Team belongs to a Project. This allows you to query the team from the project record and vice versa.
|`@manyToMany`|Configures a "join table" between two models to facilitate a many-to-many relationship. For example, a Blog has many Tags and a Tag has many Blogs.  

### Has One relationship

import gqlv2callout from "/src/fragments/cli/gqlv2callout.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: gqlv2callout}} />

Create a one-directional one-to-one relationship between two models using the `@hasOne` directive.

In the example below, a Project has a Team.
```graphql
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  team: Team @hasOne
}

type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

This generates queries and mutations that allow you to retrieve the related record from the source record:

```graphql
mutation CreateProject {
  createProject(input: {projectTeamId: "team-id", name: "Some Name"}) {
    team {
      name
      id
    }
    name
    id
  }
}
```

To customize the field to be used for storing the relationship information, set the `fields` array argument and matching it to a field on the type:

```graphql
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  teamID: ID
  team: Team @hasOne(fields: ["teamID"])
}

type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

In this case, the Project type has a `teamID` field added as an identifier for the team. @hasOne can then get the connected Team object by querying the Team table with this `teamID`:

```graphql
mutation CreateProject {
  createProject(input: { name: "New Project", teamID: "a-team-id"}) {
    id
    name
    team {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

A `@hasOne` relationship always uses a reference to the primary key of the related model, by default `id` unless overridden with the [`@primaryKey` directive](#configure-a-primary-key).

### Has Many relationship

<Fragments fragments={{all: gqlv2callout}} />

Create a one-directional one-to-many relationship between two models using the `@hasMany` directive.

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String!
}
```

This generates queries and mutations that allow you to retrieve the related Comment records from the source Post record:

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  createPost(input: {title: "Hello World!!"}) {
    title
    id
    comments {
      items {
        id
        content
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Under the hood, `@hasMany` configures a secondary index on the related table to enable you to query the related model from the source model.

You can customize the specific secondary index used for the "has many" relationship. First, configure a secondary index using `@index`. Then, pass in the secondary index name `indexName` parameter and the respective `fields` which match the connected index.

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany(indexName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID! @index(name: "byPost", sortKeyFields: ["content"])
  content: String!
}
```

In this case, the Comment type has a `postID` field added to store the reference of Post record. The `id` field referenced by `@hasMany` is the `id` on the `Post` type. `@hasMany` can then get the connected Comment object by querying the Comment table's secondary index "byPost" with this `postID`:

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  createPost(input: {title: "Hello world!"}) {
    comments {
      items {
        postID
        content
        id
      }
    }
    title
    id
  }
}
```

### Belongs To relationship
Make a "has one" or "has many" relationship bi-directional with the `@belongsTo` directive.

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name='Bi-directional "has one" relationship'>

```graphql
type Project @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  team: Team @hasOne
}

type Team @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  project: Project @belongsTo
}
```

This generates queries and mutations that allow you to retrieve the related Comment records from the source Post record and vice versa:

```graphql
mutation CreateProject {
  createProject(input: { name: "New Project", teamID: "a-team-id"}) {
    id
    name
    team { # query team from project
      id
      name
      project { # bi-directional query: team to project
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Block>

<Block name='Bi-directional "has many" relationship'>

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String!
  post: Post @belongsTo
}
```

This generates queries and mutations that allow you to retrieve the related Comment records from the source Post record and vice versa:

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  createPost(input: {title: "Hello World!!"}) {
    title
    id
    comments { # query comments from the post
      items {
        id
        content
        post { # bi-directional query: comment to post
          id
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

`@belongsTo` can be used without the `fields` argument. In those cases, a field is automatically generated to reference the parent’s primary key.

Alternatively, you set up a custom field to store the reference of the parent object. An example bidirectional “has many” relationship is shown below.

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany(indexName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID! @index(name: "byPost", sortKeyFields: ["content"])
  content: String!
  post: Post @belongsTo(fields: ["postID"])
}
```

> Note: The `@belongsTo` directive requires that a `@hasOne` or `@hasMany` relationship already exists from parent to the related model. 

### Many-to-many relationship
Create a many-to-many relationship between two models with the `@manyToMany` directive. Provide a common `relationName` on both models to join them into a many-to-many relationship. 

```graphql
type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String
  tags: [Tag] @manyToMany(relationName: "PostTags")
}

type Tag @model {
  id: ID!
  label: String!
  posts: [Post] @manyToMany(relationName: "PostTags")
}
```

Under the hood, the `@manyToMany` directive will create a "join table" named after the `relationName` to facilitate the many-to-many relationship. This generates queries and mutations that allow you to retrieve the related Comment records from the source Post record and vice versa:

```graphql
mutation CreatePost {
  createPost(input: {title: "Hello World!!"}) {
    id
    title
    content
    tags { # queries the "join table" PostTags
      items {
        tag { # related Tag records from Post
          id
          label
          posts { # queries the "join table" PostTags
            items {
              post { # related Post records from Tag
                id
                title
                content
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Assign default values for fields

You can use the `@default` directive to specify a default value for optional [scalar type fields](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/scalars.html) such as `Int`, `String`, and more. 

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  content: String @default(value: "My new Todo")
}
```

If you create a new Todo and don't supply a `content` input, Amplify will ensure that `My new Todo` is auto populated as a value. 
When `@default` is applied, non-null assertions using `!` are disregarded. For example, `String!` is treated the same as `String`.

## Advanced

### Rename generated queries, mutations, and subscriptions

You can override the names of any `@model`-generated GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions by supplying the desired name for the queries, mutations, and subscriptions. You can also disable specific operations by assigning their value to `null`.

```graphql
type Todo @model(queries: { get: "queryFor" }, mutations: null, subscriptions: null) {
  content: String!
}
```

In the example above, you'll be able to run a `queryForTodo` query to get a single Todo element. Mutations (meaning create, update, and delete) as well as subscriptions are disabled for the Todo model above.

For the type definitions of queries, mutations, and subscriptions, see [Type Definitions of the `@model` Directive](#type-definition-of-the-`@model`-directive).

### Customize creation and update timestamps
The `@model` directive automatically adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps to each entity. The timestamp field names can be changed by passing timestamps attribute to the directive.

```graphql
type Todo @model(timestamps: { createdAt: "createdOn", updatedAt: "updatedOn" }) {
  content: String
}
```

For example, the schema above will allow you to query for the following contents:

```graphql
type Todo {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  createdOn: AWSDateTime!
  updatedOn: AWSDateTime!
}
```

### Modify subscriptions (real-time updates) access level

By default, real-time updates are on for all `@model` types, which means customers receive real-time updates and authorization rules are applied during initial connection time. You can also turn off subscriptions for that model or make the real-time updates public, receivable by all subscribers.

```graphql
type Todo @model(subscriptions: { level: off }) { # or level: public
  content: String!
}
```

### Create multiple relationships between two models

You need to explicitly specify the connection field names if relational directives are used to create two connections of the same type between the two models.

```graphql
type Individual @model {
  id: ID!
  homeAddress: Address @hasOne
  shippingAddress: Address @hasOne
}

type Address @model {
  id: ID!
  homeIndividualID: ID
  shippingIndividualID: ID
  homeIndividual: Individual @belongsTo(fields: ["homeIndividualID"])
  shipIndividual: Individual @belongsTo(fields: ["shippingIndividualID"])
}
```

## How it works
The `@model` directive will generate:
- An Amazon DynamoDB table with PAY_PER_REQUEST billing mode enabled by default.
- An AWS AppSync DataSource configured to access the table above.
- An AWS IAM role attached to the DataSource that allows AWS AppSync to call the above table on your behalf.
- Up to 8 resolvers (create, update, delete, get, list, onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete) but this is configurable via the queries, mutations, and subscriptions arguments on the @model directive.
- Input objects for create, update, and delete mutations.
- Filter input objects that allow you to filter objects in list queries and relationship fields.
- For list queries the default number of objects returned is 100. You can override this behavior by setting the limit argument.

### Type definition of the `@model` directive

```graphql
directive @model(
  queries: ModelQueryMap
  mutations: ModelMutationMap
  subscriptions: ModelSubscriptionMap
  timestamps: TimestampConfiguration
) on OBJECT

input ModelMutationMap {
  create: String
  update: String
  delete: String
}

input ModelQueryMap {
  get: String
  list: String
}

input ModelSubscriptionMap {
  onCreate: [String]
  onUpdate: [String]
  onDelete: [String]
  level: ModelSubscriptionLevel
}

enum ModelSubscriptionLevel {
  off
  public
  on
}

input TimestampConfiguration {
  createdAt: String
  updatedAt: String
}
```
