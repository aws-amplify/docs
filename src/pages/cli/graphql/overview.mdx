Amplify CLI's GraphQL API category makes it easy for you to create a new GraphQL API backed by a database. Just define a GraphQL schema and Amplify CLI will automatically transform the schema into a fully functioning GraphQL API powered by AWS AppSync, Amazon DynamoDB, and more. 

## Creating your first table

First, set up your GraphQL API by running:
```bash
amplify add api
```
```console
? Select from one of the below mentioned services:
> GraphQL
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue
> Continue
? Choose a schema template:
> Single object with fields (e.g., “Todo” with ID, name, description)
...
Edit your schema at <...>/schema.graphql or place .graphql files in a directory at <...>/schema
✔ Do you want to edit the schema now? (Y/n)
> yes
Edit the file in your editor: <...>/schema.graphql
✅ Successfully added resource new locally
```

Accept the default values and your code editor should show a GraphQL schema for a Todo app.

```graphql
# This "input" configures a global authorization rule to enable public access to
# all models in this schema. Learn more about authorization rules here: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/auth
input AMPLIFY { globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public } } # FOR TESTING ONLY!

type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

Every GraphQL `type` with the `@model` directive is automatically backed by a new DynamoDB database table.

<Callout warning>

`input AMPLIFY { globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public } }` allows you to get started quickly without worrying about authorization rules. Review the [Authorization rules](/cli/graphql/authorization-rules) section to setup the appropriate access control for your GraphQL API.
</Callout>

Now let's deploy your changes to the cloud:

```bash
amplify push
```

That's it! Your API and database tables are set up. 

## Setup your app code

Use Amplify libraries to connect your app with your GraphQL endpoint. 

Add the Amplify library to your app with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```
In your app's entry point i.e. App.js, import and load the configuration file:

```js
import { Amplify, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

## Add your first record

Next, let's try to query from the GraphQL API. Choose a platform below and follow along the steps:

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify'
import { createTodo, listTodos, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/todo'
```

Then, create your first todo item with the a GraphQL API call:

```js
const result = await API.graphql(createTodo, {
  input: {
    name: 'My first todo!'
  }
})
```

## Query records from the table

Use the GraphQL query statement to list all todos in your app:

```js
const result = await API.graphql(listTodos)
console.log(result)
```

You should see the record created above: `My first todo!`.

## Update the record

To update the record use the GraphQL update mutation:

```js
const result = await API.graphql(updateTodo, {
  input: {
    id: "<...>",
    name: "My first updated todo!"
  }
})
console.log(result)
```

The result should contain the updated value: `My first updated todo!`.

## Delete a record

Let's clean up our database! Delete the todo by using the delete mutation:

```js
const result = await API.graphql(deleteTodo, {
  input: {
    id: "<...>",
  }
})
console.log(result)
```
The result output should indicate to you that the record was successfully deleted!
