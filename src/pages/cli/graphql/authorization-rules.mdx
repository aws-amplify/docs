};

<MigrationAlert url={"/cli-legacy/graphql-transformer/auth"}/>

Use the `@auth` directive to configure authorization rules for public, sign-in user, per user, and per user group data access. **Authorization rules operate on the deny-by-default principle**. Meaning that if an authorization rule is not specifically configured, it is denied.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, each signed-in user, or also known as "owner", of a Todo can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos. 

Amplify also allows you to restrict the allowed operations, combine multiple authorization rules, and apply fine-grained field-level authorization. 

``` graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [
  { allow: public, operations: [read]}
  { allow: owner }
]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, everyone (`public`) can read every Todo but owner (authenticated users) can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

### Global authorization rule (only for getting started)

To help you get started, there's a global authorization rule defined when you create a new GraphQL schema. For production environments, remove the global authorization rule and apply rules on each model instead.

```graphql
input AMPLIFY { globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public } }
```

The global authorization rule (in this case `{ allow: public }` - allows anyone to create, read, update, and delete) is applied to every data model in the GraphQL schema. 

<Callout warning>

Currently, only `{ allow: public }` is supported as a global authorization rule.

</Callout>

## Authorization strategies

Use the guide below to select the correct authorization strategy for your use case:

| **Recommended use case** | **Strategy** | **Provider** |
|---|---|---|
| Public data access. Anyone with the AppSync API Key should have access. | [`public`]() | `apiKey` |
| Recommended for production environment's public data access. Anyone signed in or not (verified by IAM) should have access. | [`public`]() | `iam` |
| Per user data access. Access is restricted to the "owner" of a record. Leverages `amplify add auth` Cognito user pool by default. | [`owner`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Any signed-in data access. Unlike owner-based access, **any** signed-in user has access. | [`private`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` / `iam` |
| Per user group data access. A specific or dynamically configured group of users have access | [`group`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Define your own custom authorization rule within a Lambda function | [`custom`]() | `function` |

### Public data access

To grant everyone access, use the `public` authorization strategy. Behind the scenes, the API will be protected with an API Key.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  content: String
}
```

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Unauthenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API Key. When you run `amplify add auth`, the  Amplify CLI generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Unauthenticated role" in Cognito identity pool automatically.

```graphql
# public authorization with provider override
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public, provider: iam }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

### Per-user / owner-based data access
To restrict a record's access to a specific user, use the `owner` authorization strategy. When `owner` authorization is configured, only the record's `owner` is allowed the specified operations. 

```graphql
# The "owner" of a Todo is allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own todos
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}

# The "owner" of a Todo record is only allowed to create, read, and update it.
# The "owner" of a Todo record is denied to delete it.
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, operations: [create, read, update] }]) {
  content: String
}
```

Behind the scenes, Amplify will automatically add a `owner: String` field to each record which contains the record owner's identity information upon record creation.

By default, the Cognito user pool's user information is populated into the `owner` field. You can alternatively configure [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

You can override the `owner` field to your own preferred field, by specifying a custom `ownerField` in the authorization rule.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, ownerField: "author" }]) {
  content: String                             #^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  author: String # record owner information now stored in "author" field
}
```

By default, only one user can be an owner of a record. If you want to grant a set of users access to a record, you can override the `ownerField` to a list of owners. Use this if you want a dynamic set of users to have access to a record.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner, ownerField: "authors" }]) {
  content: String
  authors: [String]
}
```

In the example above, upon record creation, the `authors` list is populated with the creator of the record. The creator can then update the `authors` field with additional users. Any user listed in the `authors` field can access the record.

**Known limitation**: Real-time subscriptions are not supported when `owner` authorization is configured with a list of owners.

### Signed-in user data access
To restrict a record's access to every signed-in user, use the `private` authorization strategy. 

> If you want to restrict a record's access to a specific user, see [Per-user / owner-based data access](per-user--owner-based-data-access). `private` authorization applies the authorization rule to **every** signed-in user access.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: private }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, anyone with a valid JWT token from Cognito user pool are allowed to access all Todos.

You can also override the authorization provider. In the example below, `iam` is specified as the provider which allows you to use an "Authenticated Role" from the Cognito identity pool for public access instead of an API Key. When you run `amplify add auth`, the  Amplify CLI generates scoped down IAM policies for the "Authenticated role" in Cognito identity pool automatically.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: private, provider: iam }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In addition, you can also use OpenID Connect with `private` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

### User group-based data access
To restrict access based on user groups, use the `group` authorization strategy.

**Static group authorization**: When you want to restrict access to a specific set of user groups, provide the group names in the `groups` parameter.

```graphql
type Salary @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groups: ["Admin"] }]) {
  id: ID!
  wage: Int
  currency: String
}
```

In the example above, only users that are part of the "Admin" user group are granted access to the Salary model.

**Dynamic group authorization**: When you want to restrict access to a set of user groups.

```graphql
# Dynamic group authorization with multiple groups
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groupsField: "groups" }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  groups: [String]
}

# Dynamic group authorization with a single group
type Post @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: groups, groupsField: "group" }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  group: String
}
```

With dynamic group authorization, each record contains an attribute specifying what groups should be able to access it. Use the groupsField argument to specify which attribute in the underlying data store holds this group information. To specify that a single group should have access, use a field of type `String`. To specify that multiple groups should have access, use a field of type `[String]`.

By default, `group` authorization leverages Amazon Cognito user pool groups but you can also use OpenID Connect with `group` authorization. See [OpenID Connect as an authorization provider](#using-oidc-authorization-provider).

**Known limitation**: Real-time subscriptions are not supported for dynamic group authorization.

### Custom authorization rule

You can define your own custom authorization rule with a Lambda function.

```graphql
type Salary @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: custom }]) {
  id: ID!
  wage: Int
  currency: String
}
```

The Lambda function of choice will receive an authorization token from the client and execute the desired authorization logic. The AppSync GraphQL API will receive a payload from Lambda after invocation to allow or deny the API call accordingly.

Configure the GraphQL API with the Lambda authorization mode:

```bash
amplify update api
```
```
? Select a setting to edit: 
> Authorization modes

> Lambda

? Choose a Lambda source:
> Create a new Lambda function
```

You can use the default Amplify provided template as a starting point for your custom authorization rule. The authorization Lambda function receives:

```json
{
    "authorizationToken": "ExampleAuthToken123123123", # Authorization token specified by client
    "requestContext": {
        "apiId": "aaaaaa123123123example123", # AppSync API ID
        "accountId": "111122223333", # AWS Account ID
        "requestId": "f4081827-1111-4444-5555-5cf4695f339f",
        "queryString": "mutation CreateEvent {...}\n\nquery MyQuery {...}\n", # GraphQL query
        "operationName": "MyQuery", # GraphQL operation name
        "variables": {} # any additional variables supplied to the operation
    }
}
```

Your Lambda authorization function needs to return the following JSON:

```json
{
  // required
  "isAuthorized": true, // if "false" then an UnauthorizedException is raised, access is denied
  
  // optional
  "deniedFields": ["TypeName.FieldName"], // Forces the fields to "null" when returned to the client
  "resolverContext": { "banana":"very yellow" }, // JSON object visible as $ctx.identity.resolverContext in VTL resolver templates
  "ttlOverride": 10 // The number of seconds that the response should be cached for. Overrides default specified in "amplify update api"
}
```

Review the Amplify Library documentation to set the custom authorization token for [GraphQL API](/lib/graphqlapi/authz/q/platform/js/#aws-lambda) and [DataStore](/lib/datastore/setup-auth-rules/q/platform/js/#configure-custom-authorization-logic-with-aws-lambda).

## Configure multiple authorization rules
When combining multiple authorization rules, they are "logically OR"-ed. 

```graphql
type Post @model @auth(rules: [
  { allow: public, operations: [read], provider: iam },
  { allow: owner }]) {
  title: String
  content: String
}
```

In the example above:
- any user (signed in or not, verified by IAM) is allowed to read all posts
- owners are allowed to create, read, update, and delete their own posts.

## Field-level authorization rules

When an authorization rule is added to a field, it'll strictly define the authorization rules applied on the field. Field-level authorization rules **do not** inherit model-level authorization rules. Meaning, only the specified rule is always applied. 

```graphql
type Employee @model @auth(rules: [
  { allow: private, operations: [read] },
  { allow: owner }
]) {
  name: String
  email: String
  ssn: String @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }])
}
```

<Callout warning>

To facilitate field-level authorization with subscriptions, you need to either apply field-level authorization rules to all **required** fields, make the other fields nullable, or disable subscriptions by setting it to public or off.
</Callout>

In the example above:
- **any signed in user** is allowed to read the list of employees' `name` and `email` fields
- **only the employee/owner themselves** have CRUD access to their `ssn` field

### Review and print access control matrix

Verify your API's access control matrix, by running the following command:
```bash
amplify status api -acm Blog
```
```console
iam:public
  ┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬────────┬────────┐
  │ (index) │ create │ read │ update │ delete │
  ├─────────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┤
  │  title  │ false  │ true │ false  │ false  │
  │ content │ false  │ true │ false  │ false  │
  └─────────┴────────┴──────┴────────┴────────┘
userPools:owner:owner
  ┌─────────┬────────┬──────┬────────┬────────┐
  │ (index) │ create │ read │ update │ delete │
  ├─────────┼────────┼──────┼────────┼────────┤
  │  title  │  true  │ true │  true  │  true  │
  │ content │  true  │ true │  true  │  true  │
  └─────────┴────────┴──────┴────────┴────────┘
```

### Use IAM authorization within the AppSync console
IAM-based `@auth` rules are scoped down to only work with Amplify-generated IAM roles. To access the GraphQL API with IAM authorization within your AppSync console, you need to explicitly allow list the IAM user's name by adding them to `amplify/backend/api/<your-api-name>/custom-roles.json`. (Create the `custom-roles.json` file if it doesn't exist). Append the `adminRoleNames` array with the IAM role or user names:

```json
{
  "adminRoleNames": ["<YOUR_IAM_USER_OR_ROLE_NAME>"]
}
```

These "Admin Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their IAM policy instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

### Using OIDC authorization provider
`private`, `owner`, and `group` authorization can be configured with an OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization mode. Add `provider: oidc` to the authorization rule. Upon the next `amplify push`, Amplify CLI prompts you for the *OpenID Connect provider domain*, *Client ID*, *Issued at TTL*, and *Auth Time TTL*.  

```graphql
type Todo
  @model
  @auth(rules: [
    { allow: owner, provider: oidc, identityClaim: "user_id" },
    { allow: private, provider: oidc },
    { allow: group, provider: oidc, groupClaim: "user_groups" },
  ]) {
  content: String
}
```

The example above highlights the supported authorization strategies with `oidc` authorization provider. For `owner` and `group` authorization, you also need to [specify a custom identity and group claim](#configure-custom-identity-and-group-claims).

### Configure custom identity and group claims

`@auth` supports using custom claims if you do not wish to use the default Amazon Cognito-provided "username" or "cognito:groups" claims from your JWT token. This can be helpful if you are using tokens from a 3rd party OIDC system or if you wish to populate a claim with a list of groups from an external system, such as when using a [Pre Token Generation Lambda Trigger](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-pre-token-generation.html) which reads from a database. To use custom claims specify `identityClaim` or `groupClaim` as appropriate like in the example below:

```graphql
type Post @model
  @auth(rules: [
    { allow: owner, identityClaim: "user_id" },
    { allow: groups, groups: ["Moderator"], groupClaim: "user_groups" }
  ]) {
  id: ID!
  owner: String
  postname: String
  content: String
}
```

In this example the record owner will check against a `user_id` claim. Similarly, if the `user_groups` claim contains a "Moderator" string then access will be granted.

### Grant Lambda function access to GraphQL API 
<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Function deployed using Amplify CLI">

If you grant a Lambda function in your Amplify project access to the GraphQL API via `amplify update function`, then the Lambda function's IAM execution role is allow-listed to honor the permissions granted on the `Query`, `Mutation`, and `Subscription` types.

Therefore, these functions have special access privileges that are scoped based on their IAM policy instead of any particular `@auth` rule.
</Block>

<Block name="Function deployed without Amplify CLI">

To grant an external Lambda function or an IAM role access to this GraphQL API, you need to explicitly allow list the IAM role's name by adding them to `amplify/backend/api/<your-api-name>/custom-roles.json`. (Create the `custom-roles.json` file if it doesn't exist). Append the `adminRoleNames` array with the IAM role names:

```json
{
  "adminRoleNames": ["<YOUR_IAM_ROLE_NAME>"]
}
```

These "Admin Roles" have special access privileges that are scoped based on their IAM policy instead of any particular `@auth` rule.

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

### How it works

Definition of the `@auth` directive:
```graphql
# When applied to a type, augments the application with
# owner and group-based authorization rules.
directive @auth(rules: [AuthRule!]!) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
input AuthRule {
  allow: AuthStrategy!
  provider: AuthProvider
  ownerField: String # defaults to "owner" when using owner auth
  identityClaim: String # defaults to "username" when using owner auth
  groupClaim: String # defaults to "cognito:groups" when using Group auth
  groups: [String]  # Required when using Static Group auth
  groupsField: String # defaults to "groups" when using Dynamic Group auth
  operations: [ModelOperation] # Required for finer control
}

enum AuthStrategy { owner groups private public }
enum AuthProvider { apiKey iam oidc userPools }
enum ModelOperation { create update delete read }
```

Authorization rules consists of:
- **authorization strategy** (`allow`): who the authorization rule applies to
- **authorization provider** (`provider`): which mechanism is used to apply the authorization rule (API Key, IAM, Amazon Cognito user pool, OIDC)
- **authorized operations** (`operations`): which operations are allowed for the given strategy and provider. If not specified, `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operations are allowed.

**API Keys** are best used for public APIs (or parts of your schema which you wish to be public) or prototyping, and you must specify the expiration time before deploying. **IAM** authorization uses [Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) to make request with policies attached to Roles. OIDC tokens provided by **Amazon Cognito user pool** or **3rd party OpenID Connect** providers can also be used for authorization, and enabling this provides a simple access control requiring users to authenticate to be granted top level access to API actions.
