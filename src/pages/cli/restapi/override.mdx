  description: `The "amplify override api" command generates a developer-configurable "overrides" TypeScript file which provides Amplify-generated API Gateway resources as CDK constructs. For example, developers can configure the minimum compression size of their REST API.`,
};

```bash
amplify override api
```

Run the command above to override Amplify-generated Amazon API Gateway.

The command creates a new `overrides.ts` file under `amplify/backend/api/<resource-name>/` which provides you the Amplify-generated resources as [CDK constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html).

Apply all the overrides in the `override(...)` function. For example to configure minimum compression size for the REST API:

```ts
// This file is used to override the REST API resources configuration
import { AmplifyApiRestResourceStackTemplate } from '@aws-amplify/cli-extensibility-helper';

export function override(resources: AmplifyApiRestResourceStackTemplate) {
  resources.restApi.minimumCompressionSize = 1024
}
```

You can override the following REST API resources that Amplify generates:

|Amplify-generated resource|Description|
|-|-|
|[restApi](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-restapi.html)|The Amazon API Gateway REST API created by `amplify add api`|
|[deploymentResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-deployment.html)|The deployment resource that deploys the REST API above to a stage.|
|[policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-iam-policy.html)|User pool group-related IAM policy. Example: `resources.policies["/items"].groups["Admin"]`
