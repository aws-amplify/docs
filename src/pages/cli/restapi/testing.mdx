## Test the API from the terminal

If Guest users have access to your REST API you can test it from the terminal using Curl.

[Curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) is a command-line tool that lets you transfer data to and from a server using various protocols.

> Curl is available in many distributions including Mac, Windows and Linux. Follow the install instructions in the [docs](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html).

### GET method example

```bash
curl https://a5b4c3d2e1.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/todos
```

### POST method example

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"todo-1"}' https://a5b4c3d2e1.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/todos
```

### GET method example

## Test the API with Amplify Mock

Amplify CLI allows you to quickly test your REST APIs by using the `amplify mock function` command.

Let's test your new REST API using the route below with HTTP Method `GET` and path `/todos?limit=10` which includes a `limit` query string parameter.

```console
GET /todos?limit=10
```

> Important! Testing methods using production endpoints may result in changes to resources that cannot be undone.

Before you continue, edit the file at `{project}/amplify/backend/function/todosLambda/src/event.json` and replace its content for the purpose of the test.

```json
{
  "httpMethod": "GET",
  "path": "/todos",
  "queryStringParameters": {
    "limit": "10"
  }
}
```

Make sure you have saved the changes and run

```bash
amplify mock function todosLambda
```

Select the following options:

- Provide the path to the event JSON object relative to `{project}/amplify/backend/function/todosLambda` __src/event.json__

```console
Starting execution...
EVENT: {"httpMethod":"GET","path":"/todos","queryStringParameters":{"limit":"10"}}
App started

Result:
{"statusCode":200,"body":"{\"success\":\"get call succeed!\",\"url\":\"/todos?limit=10\"}","headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","access-control-allow-origin":"*","access-control-allow-headers":"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","content-length":"55", "date":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:50:53 GMT","connection":"close"},"isBase64Encoded":false}
Finished execution.
```

## Test the API with API Gateway console

Let's test your new REST API using the route below with HTTP Method `GET` and path `/todos?limit=10` which includes a `limit` query string parameter.

```console
GET /todos?limit=10
```

> Important! Testing methods with the API Gateway console may result in changes to resources that cannot be undone.

- Sign in to the API Gateway console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway>.
- Choose the `todosApi` REST API.
- In the Resources pane, choose the method you want to test. Pick `ANY` right under `/todos`.

```console
/                        
 |_ /todos               Main resource. Eg: /todos
   ANY                   Includes methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT
   OPTIONS               Allow pre-flight requests in CORS by browser
    |_ /{proxy+}         Proxy resource. Eg: /todos/, /todos/id, todos/object/{id}
    ANY                  Includes methods: DELETE, GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT
    OPTIONS              Allow pre-flight requests in CORS by browser
```

- In the Method Execution pane, in the Client box, choose TEST. Choose the `GET` method. Add `limit=10` to the Query String `{todos}` field.

- Choose Test to run the test for `GET /todos?limit=10`. The following information will be displayed: request, status, latency, response body, response headers and logs.

```bash
Request: /todos?limit=10
Status: 200
Latency: 139 ms
Response Body
{
  "success": "get call succeed!",
  "url": "/todos?limit=10"
}
Response Headers
{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","date":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 17:36:14 GMT","content-length":"55","access-control-allow-headers":"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept","x-powered-by":"Express","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","connection":"close"}
