## Install the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

import all0 from '/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: all0 }} />

### Pre-requisites for installation

- [Install Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) if they are not already on your machine.
- Verify that you are running at least Node.js version 12.x and npm version 6.x or greater by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window
- [Create AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start). If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial.
- For Apple Silicon Macs, if you don’t already have Rosetta installed, install using `softwareupdate --install-rosetta`.

import config from '/src/fragments/cli-config.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: config }} />

### Work within your frontend project

After you install the CLI, navigate to a JavaScript, iOS, or Android project root, initialize AWS Amplify in the new directory by running `amplify init`. After a few configuration questions, you can use amplify help at any time to see the overall command structure. When you’re ready to add a feature, run `amplify add <category>`.
