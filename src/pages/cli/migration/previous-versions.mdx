#### If you are an existing Amplify CLI customer that installs the CLI using NPM, continue reading.

On January 8th, 2022, a malicious commit was made to [colors.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors/v/1.4.2) which is a dependency of Amplify CLI. This commit causes an infinite string of random characters to be printed to the terminal when running any CLI command. The issue has been patched in version 7.6.7 of the CLI. However, if you need to install a previous version of the CLI, it will not contain the patch. To install a previous version of the CLI, you can do one of the following:

### Install Amplify CLI as a native binary:

```bash
curl -sL https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-cli/install | version=v<SEMVER_VERSION> bash
```

### Install Amplify CLI from NPM with a pinned version of colors.js:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @aws-amplify/cli # only required if the CLI is already installed
npm i -g colors@1.4.0 @aws-amplify/cli@<SEMVER_VERSION>
```

Replace `<SEMVER_VERSION>` with the CLI version you want to install.
