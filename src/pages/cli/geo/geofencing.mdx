};

Amplify's `geo` category enables you to create and manage collections of Geofences used to setup virtual geographic perimeters.

<Callout>

**Note:** The Amplify Geo Geofencing feature is in developer preview and is not intended to be used in production environments. Please reach out to us for any feedback and/or issues [here](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues)

</Callout>

## Install Amplify CLI
Since the Geofencing feature is a developer preview, you need to update your Amplify CLI to try it out:

```bash
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

<Callout>

**Note:** The version of Amplify CLI should be `7.3.2-geo.3` or later. You can check the version using `amplify -v`.

</Callout>

## Setup a new Geofence Collection
Before you add a new Geofence Collection to your application, you need to have at least one Cognito User Pool group added to your project.
The permissions to perform `CRUD` operations on Geofences in the collection will be granted only to users belonging to a Cognito User Pool group that is responsible for managing these Geofences.

If you haven't set up the `auth` category already, you can do so by running:
```bash
amplify add auth
```

When you have `auth` category set up, you can add the Cognito User Pool groups using:
```bash
amplify update auth
```
```console
? What do you want to do? 
  Apply default configuration with Social Provider (Federation) 
  Walkthrough all the auth configurations 
❯ Create or update Cognito user pool groups 
  Create or update Admin queries API 

? Provide a name for your user pool group: storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

? Do you want to add another User Pool Group No

? Sort the user pool groups in order of preference
  storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

```

When you have at least one Cognito User Pool group added, you can now provision a new Geofence Collection using:
```bash
amplify add geo
```
```console
? Select which capability you want to add: 
  Map (visualize the geospatial data) 
  Location search (search by places, addresses, coordinates) 
❯ Geofencing (visualize virtual perimeters)
```

Next, set a name for the Geofence Collection: 

```console
? Provide a name for the Geofence Collection: storesInWashington
```

## Geofence Collection Access permissions

Next, configure the access permissions for your geofence collection resource and authorize users of desired Cognito User Pool groups to perform `CRUD` operations on Geofences in the collection.

```console
? Select one or more cognito groups to give access:
✔ storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

? What kind of access do you want for storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin users? Select ALL that apply:
 ✔ Read geofence
 ✔ Create/Update geofence
   Delete geofence
 ✔ List geofences
```

The above chosen permissions are granted to the users belonging the specified Cognito User Pool group. 
Please note that these permissions apply to ALL Geofences in a collection. For example, If you chose `Read geofence` permission for say `storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin`
Cognito group, ALL users added to that group will be able to read the properties of ALL Geofences in that Geofence collection.

## Geofence Collection Pricing Plan and Data Provider

Amazon Location Service offers three pricing plans namely, `RequestBasedUsage`, `MobileAssetTracking` and `MobileAssetManagement` that require no up-front commitment, and no minimum fee.
You select one of the following pricing plans for the Amazon Location Service resources you create for your application.
Amplify helps you determine the best pricing plan for you by guiding you through a set of questions.
These pricing plan related set of questions are presented to you when you add the first Geofence Collection resource to your application and can be updated later if needed. 
Once you chose the pricing plan, it will be automatically used for the ALL Geo resources added to your application.

We advice you to go through the [location service pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/location/pricing/) along with the [location service terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) (_82.5 section_) to learn more about the pricing plan.

```console
The following choices will update the pricing plan for ALL Geo resources in the project.

? Are you tracking or directing commercial assets for your business in your app?
❯ No, I do not track or direct any assets
  No, I only need to track or direct consumers' personal mobile devices
  Yes, I track or direct commercial assets (For example, any mobile object that is tracked by a company in support of its business)

## Set a default Geofence Collection
If you added more than one geofence collection via `amplify add geo`, the geofence collection that was added last will be the default. 
However, you can choose if the current geofence collection should be the default for your application:

```console
? Set this geofence collection as the default? It will be used in Amplify geofence collection API calls if no explicit reference is provided. (Y/n)
> No
```
Answering `No` will retain the previously set default.

That's it! You can now create virtual perimeters around points of interest in your application. Follow the library documentation as listed [here](/lib/geo/geofences).

## Granting Maps and/or Search permissions to a group of users
If you want to grant permissions to render a Map or Search for places to the users of a Cognito group,
you can do so as shown below:

```bash
amplify update geo
```

```console
? Select which capability you want to update: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Map (visualize the geospatial data) 
  Location search (search by places, addresses, coordinates) 
  Geofencing (visualize virtual perimeters)

? Select the Map you want to update:
❯ EsriDarkCanvasMap

? Restrict access by?
  Auth/Guest Users
  Individual Groups
❯ Both
  Learn more
```

#### Auth/Guest Users access

Select `Auth/Guest Users`, to scope permissions based on an individual user's authentication status. 
On the next question you'll be able to select if only authenticated users can access resources, or authenticated and guest users:

```
? Who can access this Map?
❯ Authorized users only
  Authorized and Guest users
```

Select `Authorized users only` if only authenticated users are allowed to render the map.

Select `Authorized and Guest users` if both authenticated and unauthenticated users are allowed to render the map.

For more information, refer [link to location service page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-get-map-tiles).

#### Individual Group access
Select `Individual Groups` to scope access permissions based on [Cognito User Groups](/cli/auth/groups)

```console
? Select one or more cognito groups to give access:
  ✔ storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin
```

> Note: If you combine `Auth/Guest user access` and `Individual Group access`, users who are members of a group will only be granted the permissions of the group, and not the authenticated user permissions.

## Upload your own GeoJSON file to geofence collection
After you have added geofence collection and provisioned the resource, you are able to upload your own GeoJSON file via the command: 
```bash
amplify geo populate
```
You can refer to [GeoJSON.IO](https://geojson.io/) where you can draw your own geofences and have GeoJSON file auto generated. After you get the GeoJSON file, you can provide the file path:
```console
? Provide the path to GeoJSON file containing the Geofences for ${your_geofence_collection} collection:
> ${your_input_geojson_file_path}
```
For each geofence feature, it requires a unique identifier. According to the [RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2), There are two options for applying identifiers:

### Root level ID

This option will use auto-generated `id` field in the root level of Feature object as identifier.
<Callout>

**Note:** This option will UPDATE your GeoJSON file

</Callout>

```console
? Do you have an identifier field in the Geofence(Feature) properties?
> No I will use the root level "id" field on Feature type. Auto-Assign if missing (this will UPDATE the GeoJSON file)
```

### Custom properties

This option allows you to choose your own fields inside `properties` of Feature object. The identifier field should have unique values among geofences.
```console
? Do you have an identifier field in the Geofence(Feature) properties?
> Yes I want to use one of the Geofence(Feature) properties as an identifier
? Provide the name of the property to use as a unique geofence identifier. Do not use Personal Identifiable Information such as email, username etc:
> ${your_input_for_unique_identifier}
```

A validation of the GeoJSON file will be executed afterwards. The upload of geofences will be triggered upon the success of validation. For the regulation of GeoJSON, please refer to [RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)
```console
✅ Successfully validated GeoJSON file.
✅ Successfully added/updated Geofences in your collection
```
