};

Amplify's `geo` category enables you to create and manage collections of Geofences used to setup virtual geographic perimeters.

<Callout>

**Note:** The Amplify Geo Geofencing feature is in developer preview and is not intended to be used in production environments. Please reach out to us for any feedback and/or issues [here](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues)

</Callout>

## Install Amplify CLI
Since the Geofencing feature is a developer preview, you need to update your Amplify CLI to try it out:

```bash
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

<Callout>

**Note:** The version of Amplify CLI should be `7.6.8-geo.0` or later. You can check the version using `amplify -v`.

</Callout>

## Setup a new Geofence Collection
Before you add a new Geofence Collection to your application, you need to have at least one Cognito User Pool group added to your project.
The permissions to perform `CRUD` operations on Geofences in the collection will be granted only to users belonging to a Cognito User Pool group that is responsible for managing these Geofences.

If you haven't set up the `auth` category already, you can do so by running:
```bash
amplify add auth
```

When you have `auth` category set up, you can add the Cognito User Pool groups using:
```bash
amplify update auth
```
```console
? What do you want to do? 
  Apply default configuration with Social Provider (Federation) 
  Walkthrough all the auth configurations 
❯ Create or update Cognito user pool groups 
  Create or update Admin queries API 

? Provide a name for your user pool group: storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

? Do you want to add another User Pool Group No

? Sort the user pool groups in order of preference
  storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

```

If you want to grant access to previously created geo resources to the users of the Cognito group added above, 
follow the instructions as mentioned [in the section below](#granting-maps-and-search-permissions-to-a-group-of-users).

When you have at least one Cognito User Pool group added, you can now provision a new Geofence Collection using:
```bash
amplify add geo
```
```console
? Select which capability you want to add: 
  Map (visualize the geospatial data) 
  Location search (search by places, addresses, coordinates) 
❯ Geofencing (visualize virtual perimeters)
```

Next, set a name for the Geofence Collection: 

```console
? Provide a name for the Geofence Collection: storesInWashington
```

## Geofence Collection Access permissions

Next, configure the access permissions for your geofence collection resource and authorize users of desired Cognito User Pool groups to perform `CRUD` operations on Geofences in the collection.

```console
? Select one or more cognito groups to give access:
✔ storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin

? What kind of access do you want for storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin users? Select ALL that apply:
 ✔ Read geofence
 ✔ Create/Update geofence
   Delete geofence
 ✔ List geofences
```

The above chosen permissions are granted to the users belonging the specified Cognito User Pool group. 
Please note that these permissions apply to ALL Geofences in a collection. For example, If you chose `Read geofence` permission for say `storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin`
Cognito group, ALL users added to that group will be able to read the properties of ALL Geofences in that Geofence collection.

## Geofence Collection Pricing Plan

The pricing plan for the Geofence Collection will be set to `RequestBasedUsage`.
We advice you to go through the [location service pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/location/pricing/) along with the [location service terms](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) (_82.5 section_) to learn more about the pricing plan.

## Set a default Geofence Collection
If you added more than one geofence collection via `amplify add geo`, the geofence collection that was added last will be the default. 
However, you can choose if the current geofence collection should be the default for your application:

```console
? Set this geofence collection as the default? It will be used in Amplify geofence collection API calls if no explicit reference is provided. (Y/n)
> No
```
Answering `No` will retain the previously set default.

That's it! You can now create virtual perimeters around points of interest in your application. Follow the library documentation as listed [here](/lib/geo/geofences).

## Granting Maps and Search permissions to a group of users
If you want to grant permissions to render a Map or Search for places to the users of a Cognito group,
you can do so as shown below:

```bash
amplify update geo
```

```console
? Select which capability you want to update: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Map (visualize the geospatial data) 
  Location search (search by places, addresses, coordinates) 
  Geofencing (visualize virtual perimeters)

? Select the Map you want to update:
❯ EsriDarkCanvasMap

? Restrict access by?
  Auth/Guest Users
  Individual Groups
❯ Both
  Learn more
```

#### Auth/Guest Users access

Select `Auth/Guest Users`, to scope permissions based on an individual user's authentication status. 
On the next question you'll be able to select if only authenticated users can access resources, or authenticated and guest users:

```
? Who can access this Map?
❯ Authorized users only
  Authorized and Guest users
```

Select `Authorized users only` if only authenticated users are allowed to render the map.

Select `Authorized and Guest users` if both authenticated and unauthenticated users are allowed to render the map.

For more information, refer [link to location service page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/latest/developerguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#security_iam_id-based-policy-examples-get-map-tiles).

#### Individual Group access
Select `Individual Groups` to scope access permissions based on [Cognito User Groups](/cli/auth/groups)

```console
? Select one or more cognito groups to give access:
  ✔ storesInWashingtonGeofenceCollectionAdmin
```

> Note: If you combine `Auth/Guest user access` and `Individual Group access`, users who are members of a group will only be granted the permissions of the group, and not the authenticated user permissions.

## Upload your own GeoJSON file to geofence collection
After you have added geofence collection and provisioned the resource, you are able to upload your own GeoJSON file via the command: 
```bash
amplify geo populate
```
You can refer to [GeoJSON.IO](https://geojson.io/) where you can draw your own geofences and have GeoJSON file auto generated. After you get the GeoJSON file, you can provide the file path:
```console
? Provide the path to GeoJSON file containing the Geofences for ${your_geofence_collection} collection:
> ${your_input_geojson_file_path}
```
For each geofence feature, it requires a unique identifier. According to the [RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2), There are two options for applying identifiers:

### Root level ID

This option will use auto-generated `id` field in the root level of Feature object as identifier.
<Callout>

**Note:** This option will UPDATE your GeoJSON file

</Callout>

```console
? Do you have an identifier field in the Geofence(Feature) properties?
> No I will use the root level "id" field on Feature type. Auto-Assign if missing (this will UPDATE the GeoJSON file)
```

### Custom properties

This option allows you to choose your own fields inside `properties` of Feature object. The identifier field should have unique values among geofences.
```console
? Do you have an identifier field in the Geofence(Feature) properties?
> Yes I want to use one of the Geofence(Feature) properties as an identifier
? Provide the name of the property to use as a unique geofence identifier. Do not use Personal Identifiable Information such as email, username etc:
> ${your_input_for_unique_identifier}
```

A validation of the GeoJSON file will be executed afterwards. The upload of geofences will be triggered upon the success of validation. For the regulation of GeoJSON, please refer to [RFC7946](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946)
```console
✅ Successfully validated GeoJSON file.
✅ Successfully added/updated Geofences in your collection
```
