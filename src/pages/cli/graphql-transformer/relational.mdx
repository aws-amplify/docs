The Amplify CLI currently supports importing serverless Amazon Aurora MySQL 5.6 databases running in the us-east-1 region. The following instruction show how to create an Amazon Aurora Serverless database, import this database as a GraphQL data source and test it.

**First, if you do not have an Amplify project with a GraphQL API create one using these simple commands.**

```bash
amplify init
amplify add api
```

**Go to the AWS RDS console and click "Create database".**

**Select "Standard Create" for the database creation method**

**For Engine Options keep the following options**

**Select "Serverless" in Database Features**

**In Settings fill in the following information**

![Database Settings](/images/database-setting.png)

**Select the Capacity Settings as shown below**

**Expand the "Additional connectivity configuration" and enable "Data API" and "Create New" if you do not have a VPC security group configured**

**Expand "Additional Configuration" and fill in "Initial Database Name" as MarketPlace**

**Click "Create Database" and dialog will open that will prompt you to connect select the cluster and fill in the credentials configured earlier**

**After connecting, create a database and some tables.**

```sql
USE MarketPlace;
CREATE TABLE Customers (
  id int(11) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  phone varchar(50) NOT NULL,
  email varchar(50) NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  id int(11) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  customerId int(11) NOT NULL,
  orderDate datetime DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  KEY `customerId` (`customerId`),
  CONSTRAINT `customer_orders_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`customerId`) REFERENCES `Customers` (`id`)
);
```

**Return to your command line and run `amplify api add-graphql-datasource` from the root of your amplify project.**

![Add GraphQL Data Source](/images/add-graphql-datasource.png)

**Push your project to AWS with `amplify push`.**

Run `amplify push` to push your project to AWS. You can then open the AppSync console with `amplify api console`, to try interacting with your RDS database via your GraphQL API.

**Interact with your SQL database from GraphQL**

Your API is now configured to work with your serverless Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Try running a mutation to create a customer from the [AppSync Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/home) and then query it from the [RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home) to double check.

Create a customer:

```graphql
mutation CreateCustomer {
  createCustomers(createCustomersInput: {
    id: 1,
    name: "Hello",
    phone: "111-222-3333",
    email: "customer1@mydomain.com"
  }) {
    id
    name
    phone
    email
  }
}
```

Then open the RDS console and run a simple select statement to see the new customer:

```sql
USE MarketPlace;
SELECT * FROM Customers;
```

### How does this work?

The `add-graphql-datasource` will add a custom stack to your project that provides a basic set of functionality for working
with an existing data source. You can find the new stack in the `stacks/` directory, a set of new resolvers in the `resolvers/` directory, and will also find a few additions to your `schema.graphql`. You may edit details in the custom stack and/or resolver files without worry. You may run `add-graphql-datasource` again to update your project with changes in the database but be careful as these will overwrite any existing templates in the `stacks/` or `resolvers/` directories. When using multiple environment with the Amplify CLI, you will be asked to configure the data source once per environment.
