In some cases, it might be necessary to execute a script before a function is deployed, e.g. to transpile Typescript or ES6 with Babel or with `tsc` into a format that is supported by the AWS Lambda's node runtime. `amplify push` will look for a `script` definition in the project root's `package.json` with the name `amplify:<resource_name>` and run it right after `npm install` is canned in the function resource's `src` directory.

**Example: Transpiling Typescript code with TSC**

Make sure you have the `tsc` command installed globally by running `npm install -g typescript` or locally by running `npm install --save-dev typescript`

Let's say, a function resource has been created with `amplify function add` and it is called `generateReport`. The ES6 source code for this function is located in `amplify/backend/function/generateReport/lib` and the resource's `src` directory only contains the auto-generated `package.json` for this function. In order to compile TypeScript, you have to add the following script definition to your project root's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "amplify:generateReport": "cd amplify/backend/function/generateReport && tsc -p ./tsconfig.json && cd -"
  },
}
```

Navigate into `amplify/backend/function/generateReport` and create `tsconfig.json` then add the following to it:

<!-- // spell-checker: disable -->
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "esnext"],
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "outDir": "./src",
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "rootDir": "./lib",
    "paths": {
      "src": ["./lib"]
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- // spell-checker: enable -->

**Note:** It is important to note that if you are using `aws-sdk` in your TypeScript file, you will get a timeout if you attempt to import it with the following:

```js
import AWS from 'aws-sdk';
```

Change to this:

```js
import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk';
```

Once you run `amplify push`, the `amplify:generateReport` script will be executed, either by `yarn` or by `npm` depending on the existence of a `yarn.lock` file in the project root directory.

**Example: Transpiling ES6 code with Babel**

Let's say, a function resource has been created with `amplify function add` and it is called `generateReport`. The ES6 source code for this function is located in `amplify/backend/function/generateReport/lib` and the resource's `src` directory only contains the auto-generated `package.json` for this function. In order to run Babel, you have to add the following script definition and dev dependencies to your project root's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "amplify:generateReport": "cd amplify/backend/function/generateReport && babel lib -d src && cd -"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@babel/cli": "^7.5.5",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.5.5",
  }
}
```

Babel needs to be configured properly so that the transpiled code can be run on AWS Lambda. This can be done by adding a `.babelrc` file to the resource folder (`amplify/backend/function/generateReport/.babelrc` in this case):

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "env",
      {
        "exclude": ["transform-regenerator"],
        "targets": {
          "node": "10.18"
        }
      }
    ]
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "transform-async-to-generator",
    "transform-exponentiation-operator",
    "transform-object-rest-spread"
  ]
}
```

Once you run `amplify push`, the `amplify:generateReport` script will be executed, either by `yarn` or by `npm` depending on the existence of a `yarn.lock` file in the project root directory.

<Block name="Python">

There are no existing build options for Python functions. The process of building and packaging Python functions is in line with Amazon's [existing documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html#python-package-venv) for manually creating a Lambda deployment package which depends on a virtual environment.

Amplify will run `pipenv install` in your function's source directory during builds using either Pipenv's default virtual environment, or whichever virtual environment happens to be active. Then, during the packaging stage, the contents of the `site-packages` directory for that virtual environment will be zipped up along with the function-specific files.

The contents of the Python build can include local development dependencies (e.g. for testing) in addition to those necessary for your function to run. Packages installed as "editable" (using the `-e` flag) will not be  packaged, as they are represented as an `.egg-link` file pointing to the local, editable code of the dependency.
