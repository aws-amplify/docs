## Build Options

There are no existing build options for Python functions. The process of building and packaging Python functions is in line with Amazon's [existing documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html#python-package-venv) for manually creating a Lambda deployment package which depends on a virtual environment.

Amplify CLI will run `pipenv install` in your function's source directory during builds using either Pipenv's default virtual environment, or whichever virtual environment happens to be active. Then, during the packaging stage, the contents of the `site-packages` directory for that virtual environment will be zipped up along with the function-specific files.

The contents of the Python build can include local development dependencies (e.g. for testing) in addition to those necessary for your function to run. Packages installed as "editable" (using the `-e` flag) will not be packaged, as they are represented as an `.egg-link` file pointing to the local, editable code of the dependency.
