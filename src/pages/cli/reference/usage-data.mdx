At AWS, we develop and launch services based on what we learn from interactions with our customers. We use customer feedback to iterate on our product. Anonymized usage data helps us to better understand our customersâ€™ needs, diagnose issues, and deliver features that improve the customer experience.

Amplify CLI sends anonymized information such as system metadata, usage metrics and errors. The data is marked for deletion in a year from the point of it being collected. Amplify CLI does **not** collect personally identifiable information such as email addresses, usernames, keys, ARNs or any project - level information.
