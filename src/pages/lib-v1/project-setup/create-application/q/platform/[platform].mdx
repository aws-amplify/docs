To set up the project, you will need to create a new Next.js app with the
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) tool.
You'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

Run the following command and following the instructions to create a Next.js app.

```shellscript
npx create-next-app@">=13.4.0 <14.0.0" next-amplified
```

Then run the following command to enter the root of your Next.js app.

```shellscript
cd next-amplified
```

You can now run the app in development mode by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

</Block>

<Block name="Angular">

Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new amplify-app

? Would you like to add Angular routing? Y
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (your preferred stylesheet provider)

cd amplify-app
```

Angular 6+ does not include shims for 'global' or 'process'.

<Block name="Angular 15">

First, create `src/polyfills.ts` and add the following:

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

Then, open your `angular.json` file, and add `src/polyfills.ts` to polyfills array(s) in your `angular.json`. These arrays are located in projects.`<project-name>.architect.<task-name>.options`.

```javascript
"polyfills": [
  "zone.js",
  "src/polyfills.ts"
],
```

And finally, make sure to add `src/polyfills` to files in your `tsconfig.app.json`:

```javascript
{
  "files": [
    "src/main.ts",
    "src/polyfills.ts"
  ],
}
```
</Block>

<Block name="Angular 6-14">

Add the following to your `src/polyfills.ts` file to recreate them: 

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

<Block name="ReactJS">

To get started, first create a new React app, and then install and use the Amplify CLI to start adding backend capabilities to your app.

From your projects directory, run the following commands and follow the prompts:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
This creates a new React app in a new directory. Navigate to your new directory and run the app by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and allows you to see the output generated by the build.

## Initialize a new backend

Now that you have a running Vue app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. 

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

Your backend needs a project name to use when creating resources.
Give your backend project the name `todo`
```console
? Enter a name for the project (myamplifyproject) todo
```

You'll then be asked to accept some recommended values:

```
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: todo
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: vue
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: dist
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script serve

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes

```

> Where possible the CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in. In this case it knew you are using Vue and provided the proper configuration for type of app, framework, source, distribution, build, and start options.

Next, you will need to select the authentication method you want to use to work on your project locally:

```
? Select the authentication method you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
> AWS profile
  AWS access keys
```
Select AWS profile and then choose the profile you configured in the [Prerequisites](/start/getting-started/installation/q/integration/vue/#configure-the-amplify-cli).

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Install Amplify libraries

The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:


<Block name="NPM">

```
npm install aws-amplify@next
```

</Block>

<Callout>

If you are using Vue 2, please check out our legacy [documentation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/legacy/legacy/amplify-ui-vue). For Vite installs check out this [documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/vue/getting-started/installation#vite). 

</Callout>

import ui_callout from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/v6/callout/ui.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'all': ui_callout }} />

# Set up frontend

Next, you need to configure Amplify on the client so that you can use it to interact with your backend services.

Open __src/main.js__ and add the following code below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsExports from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

## Vue Vite Config

When working with a Vue `create-app` that uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) you must make a few additional modifications. Please follow the steps below.

**1.** Add the following script tag to the `index.html` file at the bottom of the `<body>` tag.

```html
...
  <script>
        window.global = window;
        var exports = {};
  </script>
</body>
```

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify with Vue and `create-app`. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in __aws-exports.js__ will update automatically.

Now that your Vue app is set up and Amplify is initialized, you're ready to add an API in the next step.

## Create a New Amplify Backend

Now that you have a running app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you
can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app.

<Callout warning>

Please ensure the Amplify CLI version in
your system is higher than `12.5.1`. You can check the CLI version by
running `amplify --version`.

</Callout>

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app.

```console
? Enter a name for the project (nextamplified)
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: nextamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: <detected framework>
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend
definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API
and authentication. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with
infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack.
Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` in the `src` directory that holds
all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the
Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be
accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend
environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status
of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete
backend resources

As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration
using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in `amplifyconfiguration.json` will update
automatically.

## Install Amplify libraries

Install required dependencies to your Next.js app to start using Amplify.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@next
```

You are now ready to start adding features to your application.
