In this guide, you will learn how to set up Amplify **Auth**. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources, determining your integration path, and enabling sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out. We will also provide more context on how resources are managed and created with Amplify to help you make decisions, and understand any long-term impact of those decisions.

Before you begin, you will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14.4 or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later
- A frontend app
- If you want Amplify to set up and manage your backend resources you need to [install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI. Make sure to also create a new Amplify project using `amplify init` in your terminal, or pull in an existing Amplify project to your frontend app by using `amplify pull`.

## Set up and connect backend resources

We will review the paths to integrate Amplify Auth before you set up and integrate your backend resources and connect these resources in your frontend app to build authentication features.

### Decide how to create and manage your backend resources

You can create and manage your Authentication resources with Amplify by using the Amplify CLI, Amplify Studio, or manage them yourself with tools such as CDK and CloudFormation. The path we recommend is via the Amplify CLI, which allows you to create new authentication resources or import existing ones. However, you can also use the Amplify Studio console to configure or use existing resources and directly connect them to your application using the Amplify Libraries. These tools will help you with creating and managing your resources.

With Amplify Auth, you can use a username and password as an authentication method, use a social provider such as "Sign In with Google" or "Sign in With Apple," or create a fully custom authentication flow.

<Accordion title='Understanding Auth high-level concepts' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

 - *Authentication* is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as *AuthN*). The system which does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
 - *Authorization* is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as *AuthZ*). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include: 
- Username/password which is simple to set up but prone to compromise.
- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties. 

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by: 
- Adding password policies that ensure stronger passwords are created by your users.
- Require additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Add multi-factor authentication which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery, and other operations. If you have not worked with Amazon Cognito before we recommend taking a closer look at Amazon Cognito configuration options before you continue, since some of them are irreversible after your resources are created.

<Accordion title='Review Amazon Cognito configuration options' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amazon Cognito can be customized based on your security strategy for authentication. However, there are some initial configuration options that cannot be changed after the backend resources are configured:

- User attributes that are used to identify your individual users (e.g. username, email, etc.) cannot be renamed or deleted.
- Sign-in methods (including username, email, phone, etc.) cannot be added or changed after the initial configuration. This includes both defining which attributes are used to sign in and which attributes are required. Required attributes must have a value for all users once set.
- Verification methods (including username, email, etc.) are the same as required attributes and cannot be removed once configured.
- The `sub` attribute is a unique identifier within each user pool that cannot be modified and can be used to index and search users.
- If MFA is set to required for all users, you will need to include MFA setup when users sign up.

See the [Amazon Cognito documentation]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) for more details on these settings including [User pool attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) and [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).

### Set up and configure Amplify Auth

In this section you will learn how to set up your backend resources and install the Amplify Libraries to use with your application.

#### Set up your Auth backend resources

You can set up your backend resources with the Amplify CLI or use existing resources.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI (Create)">

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify Libraries.

To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add auth
```

```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?  No, I am done.
```
> If you have previously enabled an Amplify category that uses Auth behind the scenes (e.g. API category), you can run the `amplify update auth` command to edit your configuration if needed. 

The CLI prompts will help you to customize your auth flow for your app. With the provided options, you can:
- Customize sign-in/registration flow 
- Customize email and SMS messages for Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customize attributes for your users, e.g. name, email
- Enable 3rd party social providers, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon

<Callout warning>

  If you need to support Multi-Factor Authentication (i.e. TOTP & SMS codes) in your application make sure to enable it during this step to avoid having to revisit this process. Please see [Set Up Backend Resources](/lib-v1/auth/mfa/q/platform/js/#set-up-backend-resources) for more information.

</Callout>

If you wish to federate with social providers [you will need to configure them first](/lib/auth/social#social-providers-and-federation).

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

</Block>

<Block name="Amplify CLI (Import)">

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify Libraries.

To import existing Amazon Cognito resources into your Amplify project, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify import auth
```

```console
? What type of auth resource do you want to import?
   Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
   Cognito User Pool only
```

Once you've selected an option, you'll be able to search for and import an existing Cognito user pool and identity pool (or user pool only) within your AWS account.  The `amplify import auth` command will also do the following:
- Automatically populate your Amplify Library configuration files (aws-exports.js, amplifyconfiguration.json) with your chosen Amazon Cognito resource information
- Provide your designated existing Cognito resource as the authentication & authorization mechanism for all auth-dependent categories (API, Storage and more)
- Enable Lambda functions to access the chosen Cognito resource if you permit it

> If you have previously enabled an Amplify category that uses Auth behind the scenes (e.g. API category), you can run the `amplify update auth` command to edit your configuration if needed. 

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

</Block>

<Block name="Existing Resources">

Existing Authentication resources from AWS (e.g. Amazon Cognito user pools or identity pools) can be used with the Amplify Libraries by calling the `Amplify.configure()` method. 

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    // Configure Amplify for use with your user pool
    Cognito: {
      // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
      userPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234',

      // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
      userPoolClientId: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3',

      // OPTIONAL - This is used when autoSignIn is enabled for Auth.signUp
      // 'code' is used for Auth.confirmSignUp, 'link' is used for email link verification
      signUpVerificationMethod: 'code', // 'code' | 'link'

      // OPTIONAL - Hosted UI configuration
      loginWith: {
        oauth: {
          domain: 'your_cognito_domain',
          scope: [
            'phone',
            'email',
            'profile',
            'openid',
            'aws.cognito.signin.user.admin',
          ],
          redirectSignIn: ['http://localhost:3000/'],
          redirectSignOut: ['http://localhost:3000/'],
          responseType: 'code', // or 'token', note that REFRESH token will only be generated when the responseType is code
        },
      }
    }
  },
});
```
<Callout warning={true}>
If your existing user pool client has a required attribute that is NOT set to mutable, you may face login issues when using Social sign-in. To resolve this, you will need to <ExternalLink href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">create a new user pool client</ExternalLink> and mark the required attribute as mutable.
</Callout>

#### OAuth configuration parameters:
These settings can be found in the user pool console under **App Integration** section
- `domain`: This can be found in the **Domain name** sub section
- `scope`: Remember to have the scope allowed on the Cognito App client, this can be found on **App client settings** sub section
- `redirectSignIn`: URL must be present on **Callback URL(s)** , check on **App client settings** sub section
- `redirectSignOut`: URL must be present on **Sign out URL(s)**, check on **App client settings** sub section
- `responseType`: Option must be enabled on the App client, look for **Allowed OAuth Flows** on **App client settings** sub section. *Authorization code grant* is for 'code' value and *Implicit grant* is for 'token' value.

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

You now have set up and configured your backend resources for Amplify Auth, and connected your frontend app to your backend. You are now ready to work on your frontend application.

## Integrating your Application with Auth APIs

The v6 Developer Preview is not yet compatible with the Amplify Authenticator component. To integrate Auth with your application, you will need to build your own interface and invoke the auth APIs. Please review the [*Enable Sign-up, Sign-in, and Sign-out*](/lib/auth/emailpassword/q/platform/js/) guide for more information on these APIs.

### View the created user in the AWS Console

After creating a new user, you can validate the created user in the Amazon Cognito console. To do so, you can use `amplify console auth` to open the AWS console directly. Note the user's status should be `CONFIRMED` if you successfully verified the user; however, it can be in `UNCONFIRMED` if the user is not yet verified. You can also check to make sure your user attributes are updating correctly.

## Next steps

Now that you completed setting up Amplify Auth with username/password you may also want to add some additional features. We recommend you learn more about:
  - [Social sign-in (OAuth)](/lib-v1/auth/social/q/platform/js/)
  - [Multi-factor authentication](/lib-v1/auth/mfa/q/platform/js/)
