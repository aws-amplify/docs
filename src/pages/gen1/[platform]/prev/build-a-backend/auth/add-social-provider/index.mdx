You can enable your users to sign-in and authenticate with your app using their existing accounts with social providers like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Once you configure your backend resources, you can then configure your app to sign in users for that provider. This process will securely exchange credentials and gather user information. This information can then be used to create a new user in your app or link the social account to an existing user. Incorporating social provider sign-in provides your users with a streamlined registration, more sign-in options, and an integrated experience across their existing accounts and your app.

In this guide we will review how you can add sign-in with social providers by first setting up your developer account with the provider. After this step, you can then configure your Auth category and integrate social sign-in with your app.

Before you begin, you will need:

- An Amplify project
- The Amplify libraries installed and configured

<Accordion title='Review how OAuth authentication works' headingLevel='3' eyebrow='Learn more'>

The preferred way to incorporate social provider sign-in is via an OAuth redirect which lets users sign in using their social media account and creates a corresponding user in the Cognito User Pool.

[OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is the common Authorization framework used by web and mobile applications for accessing user information ("scopes") in a limited manner. Common analogies you will hear in OAuth is that of boarding a plane or staying in a hotel - showing your identification is the authentication piece (signing into an app) and using the boarding pass/hotel key is what you are authorized to access.

OAuth support in Amplify uses Cognito User Pools and supports federation with social providers, which will automatically create a corresponding user in the User Pool after they sign in. With this design you do not need to include an SDK for the social provider in your app. After you set up your developer account with these social providers you can configure the `Auth` category by running `amplify add auth` and selecting the social provider option. You can then use `Auth.federatedSignIn()` in your app to either show a pre-built "Hosted UI" or pass in a provider name (e.g. `Auth.federatedSignIn({provider: 'Facebook'})`) to interface directly and build your own UI. ![Image](/images/SocialAuthZ.png) Alternatively, you can also get credentials directly from Identity Pools by passing tokens from a social provider directly with `Auth.federatedSignIn()`. However you will have to use that provider's SDK in your app as well as manage the tokens from the provider and their refresh cycles manually.

</Accordion>

## Set up your social auth provider

Before you configure social sign-in with Amplify Auth you will need to set up your developer account with each provider you are using.

**Note:** Amazon Cognito provides first class support for Facebook Login, Google Sign-In, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple for seamless setup. However you can configure other Identity Providers that support SAML or OpenID Connect (OIDC).

Your developer accounts with the social providers are now set up and you can return to your Amplify project for next steps.

## Configure the Auth category

Once you have the social providers configured you can update your Auth configuration through the Amplify CLI.

<Callout warning>

When configuring social sign-in through the Amplify CLI, it's important to exercise caution when designating attributes as "required". Each social identity provider has different information they send back to Cognito. User Pool attributes that are initially set up as "required" cannot be changed later. You may have to migrate the users or create a new User Pool if you need to change requirements.

</Callout>

To begin with the CLI, run the following in your project’s root folder:

```bash
amplify add auth     ## "amplify update auth" if already configured
```

You have configured your Auth category and updated your URL with the social providers. You can now set up the frontend for your app.

## Set up your frontend

After configuring the OAuth endpoints (with Cognito Hosted UI), you can integrate your app by invoking the `Auth.federatedSignIn()` function which will redirect the user to the Cognito Hosted UI and provide options to sign in via user name password as well as any of the Social providers you have configured. Also, note that passing `LoginWithAmazon`, `Facebook`, `Google`, or `SignInWithApple` on the `provider` argument (e.g `Auth.federatedSignIn({ provider: 'LoginWithAmazon' })`) will bypass the Hosted UI and federate immediately with the social provider as shown in the below example.

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>

<Callout>

**Note:** You can also use the [Authenticator UI component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/authenticator) to add social sign in flow to your application. Visit [Social Provider](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/authenticator/configuration#social-providers) section to learn more.

</Callout>

If you are looking to add a custom state, you are able to do so by passing a string value (e.g. `Auth.federatedSignIn({ customState: 'xyz' })`) and listening for the custom state via [Hub](/[platform]/build-a-backend/utilities/hub/). You can also use the Hub eventing system to catch errors using `Auth.federatedSignIn()` to listen for the `signIn_failure` event.

### Redirect URLs

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>

For _Sign in Redirect URI(s)_ inputs, you can put one URI for local development and one for production. Example: `http://localhost:3000/` in dev and `https://www.example.com/` in production. The same is true for _Sign out redirect URI(s)_.

If you have multiple redirect URI inputs, you'll need to handle both of them where you configure your Amplify project. For example:

```javascript
import awsConfig from './aws-exports';

const isLocalhost = Boolean(
  window.location.hostname === 'localhost' ||
    // [::1] is the IPv6 localhost address.
    window.location.hostname === '[::1]' ||
    // 127.0.0.1/8 is considered localhost for IPv4.
    window.location.hostname.match(
      /^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/
    )
);

// Assuming you have two redirect URIs, and the first is for localhost and second is for production
const [localRedirectSignIn, productionRedirectSignIn] =
  awsConfig.oauth.redirectSignIn.split(',');

const [localRedirectSignOut, productionRedirectSignOut] =
  awsConfig.oauth.redirectSignOut.split(',');

const updatedAwsConfig = {
  ...awsConfig,
  oauth: {
    ...awsConfig.oauth,
    redirectSignIn: isLocalhost
      ? localRedirectSignIn
      : productionRedirectSignIn,
    redirectSignOut: isLocalhost
      ? localRedirectSignOut
      : productionRedirectSignOut
  }
};

Amplify.configure(updatedAwsConfig);

For _Sign in Redirect URI(s)_ inputs, you can put one URI for local development and one for production. For example, in Expo: `exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/` in dev and `myapp://` in production. The same is true for _Sign out redirect URI(s)_.

If you have multiple redirect URI inputs, you'll need to handle both of them where you configure your Amplify project. For example:

```javascript
import awsConfig from './aws-exports';

const isLocalhost = Boolean(__DEV__);

// Assuming you have two redirect URIs, and the first is for localhost and second is for production
const [localRedirectSignIn, productionRedirectSignIn] =
  awsConfig.oauth.redirectSignIn.split(',');

const [localRedirectSignOut, productionRedirectSignOut] =
  awsConfig.oauth.redirectSignOut.split(',');

const updatedAwsConfig = {
  ...awsConfig,
  oauth: {
    ...awsConfig.oauth,
    redirectSignIn: isLocalhost
      ? localRedirectSignIn
      : productionRedirectSignIn,
    redirectSignOut: isLocalhost
      ? localRedirectSignOut
      : productionRedirectSignOut
  }
};

Amplify.configure(updatedAwsConfig);
```

For React Native applications, you need to define a custom URL scheme for your application before testing locally or publishing to the app store. This is different for Expo or vanilla React Native. For Expo, follow the steps in [Expo Linking Guide](https://docs.expo.io/guides/linking/). For vanilla React Native, follow the steps in [React Native Linking Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking). After completing those steps, assuming you are using `myapp` as the name of your URL Scheme (or whatever friendly name you have chosen), you will use these URLs as _Sign in Redirect URI(s)_ and/or _Sign out redirect URI(s)_ inputs. Your URIs could look like any of these:

- `myapp://`
- `exp://127.0.0.1:19000/--/` (Local development if your app is running [in the Expo client](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/linking/#linking-to-your-app)).

### Use the in-app browser plugin for React Native

By default, Amplify will open the Cognito Hosted UI in Safari/Chrome, but you can override that behavior by providing a custom `urlOpener`. While this is optional, it is recommended.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="React Native">

<Callout>

**Note for iOS Apps:** In order for Amplify to listen for data from Cognito when linking back to your app, you will need to setup the `Linking` module in `AppDelegate.m` (see [React Native docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking#enabling-deep-links) for more information):

```objectivec
#import <React/RCTLinkingManager.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
   openURL:(NSURL *)url
   options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey,id> *)options
{
  return [RCTLinkingManager application:application openURL:url options:options];
}
```

</Callout>

The sample below uses [react-native-inappbrowser-reborn](https://github.com/proyecto26/react-native-inappbrowser), but you can use any other in-app browser available.

### Deploy your backend environment with auth parameters for social sign-in

When you create or update your authentication configuration, Amplify will setup the configuration locally, but it does not automatically deploy the changes to your backend environment. You will need to run `amplify push` to deploy the changes to your backed environment.

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>

You can deploy your app to the Amplify Console with continuous deployment of the frontend and backend, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html#creating-a-new-backend-environment-with-authentication-parameters).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Add social provider sign-in** guide. In this guide, you learned how to set up your social auth provider, configure the Amplify Auth category for social sign-in, and set up the frontend. Your users can now sign into your app using their social provider accounts.

## Next steps

Now that you have social provider sign-in you may also want to learn additional ways to customize these workflows. We recommend you learn more about:
