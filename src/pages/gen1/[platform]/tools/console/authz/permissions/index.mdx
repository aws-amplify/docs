You are going to define set up role-based authorization rules for each of the models that you created for your bookstore example. Authorization rules help in restricting who can query or update a table based on certain conditions. 

## To set an owner authorization rule
1. Using the *Books* data model that you created in the [Create a data model example](/[platform]/tools/console/data/data-model/#Create-a-data-model-example), set the authorization mode to **Cognito user pool**. 
2. In the **Model** pane on the right, expand the **Owners** window. 
3. Choose **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** to specify that *Owners* have create, read, update, and delete access. The settings look as follows.

## To set a private authorization rule
1. Using the *Books* data model that you created in the [Create a data model example](/[platform]/tools/console/data/data-model/#Create-a-data-model-example), set the authorization mode to **Cognito user pool**. 
2. In the **Model** pane on the right, expand the **Any signed-in users** window. 
3. Choose **Create**, **Read**, and **Update** to specify that any signed-in authenticated user has create, read, and update, access.

## To set a group authorization rule
1. Using the *Books* data model that you created in the [Create a data model example](/[platform]/tools/console/data/data-model/#Create-a-data-model-example), set the authorization mode to **Cognito user pool**. 
2. Create an *Editors* group using the instructions to [create a group](/[platform]/tools/console/auth/user-management/#To-create-a-group). Alternately, you can create a new group from the **Add a new rule for...** menu.
3. In the **Model** pane on the right, select *Editors* from the **Add a new rule for...** menu.

4. Choose **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** to specify that signed in users in the *Editors* group have create, read, update, and delete access.

## To set a public authorization rule

If you want your data model to be publicly accessible, switch to API_KEY or IAM based authorization.

1. Using the *Books* data model that you created in the [Create a data model example](/[platform]/tools/console/data/data-model/#Create-a-data-model-example), set the authorization mode to **API Key**. 
2. In the **Model** pane on the right, expand the **Anyone** window. Choose **Read** to specify that any signed in user has read access to the data in the *Book* model.
