With Amplify Studio, team members with different job functions can collaborate on different aspects of a project deployed in Amplify. Studio developers can create accounts with admin or manage-only access to resources and invite team members to join via email.

Follow these instructions to add and manage team members and their access to a project.

## To invite team members to access a project

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify.
2. Select your Amplify project with Amplify Studio enabled.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **Amplify Studio settings**.
4. On the **Amplify Studio settings** page, in the **Access control settings** section, choose **Add team members**.
5. For **Email**, enter the email address of the team member to invite.
6. For **Access level**, choose the level of access to grant the team member.
  * **Full access** allows the team member to create and manage AWS resources.
  * **Manage only** access allows the team member to edit app content and users.
7. To email the invitation, choose **Send invite**. The team member receives an email with temporary credentials and a link to access the project in Studio.

<Callout warning>

  Granting a user the **Full Access** level attaches the **AdministratorAccess-Amplify** IAM policy. This IAM policy is not scoped to a single application and grants the user access to all applications within the AWS account. See [AWS managed policies for AWS Amplify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html) for more details.

</Callout>

## To edit team member access or delete a user
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify.
2. Select your Amplify project with Amplify Studio enabled.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **Amplify Studio settings**.
4. On the **Amplify Studio settings** page, in the **Access control settings** section, select the team member to edit or delete.
5. Do one of the following:
  * Choose **Edit**. In the **Edit team member(s)** window, choose the **Access level** for the team member.
  * Choose **Delete**. In the **Delete users** window, confirm the delete action.

<Callout warning>

If a team member logs into Amplify Studio, their login token is valid for 5 hours 30 minutes, unless they explicitly log out. When you change a team member's permission from **Full access** to **Manage only** or when you delete a team member's access, the team member can continue accessing Amplify Studio with their previously granted permissions until their token expires.

## Understanding how Studio manages user access

<Callout warning>

  The following resources are all managed by Studio. **Manual changes to these resources may affect your login experience**.

</Callout>

### User pool
Studio manages user access using an Amazon Cognito User Pool in your account. You can invite up to 50,000 monthly users to Studio without cost.

Studio manages user access using an Amazon Cognito User Pool in your account, named:
- *amplify_backend_manager_APPID*.

### IAM Roles
In order to give the *Full access* and *Manage only* groups the necessary permissions, Studio creates 2 IAM roles, named:
- *USERPOOLID_Full-access*
- *USERPOOLID_Manage-only*

### Cognito Identity Pool
An Amazon Cognito Identity Pool is also created to vend AWS credentials that are tied to the *Full access* and *Manage only* groups, named:
- *amplify_backend_manager_APPID*

### Cognito Lambda triggers
To provide a passwordless login experience from AWS Amplify Console to Amplify Studio, Studio creates 4 Cognito Lambda triggers *associated with the above-mentioned User Pool*, named:
- *amplify-login-create-auth-challenge-SHORT_CODE*
- *amplify-login-custom-message-SHORT_CODE*
- *amplify-login-define-auth-challenge-SHORT_CODE*
- *amplify-login-verify-auth-challenge-SHORT_CODE*

## Troubleshooting
If your Studio application experiences any issues logging in or the resources have been deleted, you can re-create the resources by disabling and then re-enabling Studio for your Amplify Project on the Amplify management console.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify.
2. Select your Amplify project with Amplify Studio enabled.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **Amplify Studio settings**.
4. Turn off **Enable Amplify Studio.**
5. Turn on **Enable Amplify Studio.**

<Callout warning>
   Disabling and re-enabling Amplify Studio will remove and recreate the Amplify Studio managed User pool resource used to access your project, and you will need to re-invite your users to provide access to your Amplify Project. Disabling and re-enabling Amplify Studio will not modify any resources on your Amplify Project.
</Callout>

### I am not authorized to perform an action in Amplify
If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform an action, your policies must be updated to allow you to perform the action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials. See [AWS managed policies for AWS Amplify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html) for more details.

### Updating Login Cognito Lambda triggers runtime

If you need to update the [Cognito Lambda triggers](/gen1/[platform]/tools/console/adminui/access-management/#cognito-lambda-triggers) runtime, you can do so by updating the Lambda functions triggers associated with the Cognito User Pool named **`amplify_backend_manager_<app-id>`**.

1. Log in to the **AWS Management Console**, open the **Amplify console** and select your Amplify project with Amplify Studio enabled.
2. Retrieve the App ID present on the overview page under the App name.
3. Go to **Amazon Cognito console**, select **User pools**. Search for the user pool with the App Id. You will observe the app user pool with the naming format `amplify_backend_manager_<app-id>`.
4. Select the user pool and go to **User Pool Properties** which should display the **Lambda Triggers**. 
![Cognito Lambda Triggers created by studio](/images/studio/lambda-triggers-studio.png)
5. For each lambda trigger, select the link specified in the **Attached Lambda Function** column. Note, If your lambda trigger is **Verify auth challenge response Lambda trigger** the function requires additional steps provided on [Update verify auth challenge response Lambda trigger](/gen1/[platform]/tools/console/adminui/access-management/#update-verify-auth-challenge-response-lambda-trigger) section. 
6. Select **Edit runtime settings** and change the runtime to **Node.js 20.x** from the drop-down options.
![Lambda runtime](/images/studio/lambda_runtime.png)
7. Finally, select **Save**.

### Update verify auth challenge response Lambda trigger

This function requires code change as Lambda with **NodeJS 20.x** use a newer version of **aws-sdk**.

1. Go to Lambda Code Source and select `index.js` file.
![Lambda source code section for a Cognito trigger resource](/images/studio/trigger_source_code.png)
2. Replace the contents of `index.js` with the following:

```js
const { AmplifyBackendClient, GetTokenCommand, DeleteTokenCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-amplifybackend');

exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  try {
    const amplifyBackendService = new AmplifyBackendService(event);
    await amplifyBackendService.validateToken();
    console.log(`verified challenge code with result: ${event.response.answerCorrect}`);
    context.done(null, event);
    return event;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('exception occurred during verify', e);
    event.response.answerCorrect = false;
    context.done(e, event);
  }
};

class AmplifyBackendService {
  constructor(event) {
    const { sessionId, appId } = event.request.clientMetadata;
    const { challengeAnswer } = event.request;
    this.appId = appId;
    this.sessionId = sessionId;
    this.challengeAnswer = challengeAnswer;
    this.event = event;
  }

  async validateToken() {
    this.amplifyBackend = this.initService();
    // 1. Get token
    const tokenResponse = await this.getToken();

    // 2. Validate token
    const challengeCode = tokenResponse.ChallengeCode;
    if (challengeCode && this.challengeAnswer && this.challengeAnswer === challengeCode) {
      this.event.response.answerCorrect = true;
    } else {
      this.event.response.answerCorrect = false;
    }

    // 3. Delete token
    await this.deleteToken();

    return this.event.response.answerCorrect;
  }

  initService() {
    const amplifyBackend = process.env.ENDPOINT
      ? new AmplifyBackendClient({
          endpoint: process.env.ENDPOINT,
        })
      : new AmplifyBackendClient();
    return amplifyBackend;
  }

  getToken() {
    return this.amplifyBackend.send(
      new GetTokenCommand({
        AppId: this.appId,
        SessionId: this.sessionId,
      }),
    );
  }

  deleteToken() {
    return this.amplifyBackend.send(
      new DeleteTokenCommand({
        AppId: this.appId,
        SessionId: this.sessionId,
      }),
    );
  }
}

exports.AmplifyBackendService = AmplifyBackendService;
```

3. Finally, select **Deploy** to save the changes.
