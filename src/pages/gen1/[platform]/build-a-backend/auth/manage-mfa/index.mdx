Amplify Auth supports Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for user sign-in flows. MFA is an extra layer of security used to make sure that users trying to gain access to an account are who they say they are. It requires users to provide additional information to verify their identity. Amplify Auth supports the MFA methods with Time-based-One-Time Passwords (TOTP) as well as text messages (SMS). In this guide we will review how you can set up MFA using TOTP and SMS and the tradeoffs between these methods to help you choose the right set up for your application. We will also review how to set up MFA to remember a device and reduce sign-in friction for your users.

Before you begin, you will need:

- An Amplify app set up (see the [quickstart](/gen2/start/quickstart/) if you need to set up an app)
- _Optional_ If you are using SMS you will need a phone number provisioned with an [SNS/Pinpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/channels-sms-originating-identities.html)

## Configure multi-factor authentication backend

Use `defineAuth` to enable MFA for your app. The example below is setting up MFA with TOTP but not SMS as you can see that the phone number is not a required attribute. If you are using SMS, then the `PhoneNumber` attribute must be `true`.

```diff title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true
  },
+ multifactor: {
+   mode: 'optional',
+   totp: true
+ }
});
```

After you enable MFA you will also need to include MFA setup when users sign up. This will change depending on if you enable SMS, TOTP or both.

### Understand your MFA options

When enabling MFA you will have two key decisions to make:

- **MFA enforcement:** As part of this setup you will determine how MFA is enforced. If you require MFA by setting MFA login to "ON", all your users will need to complete MFA to sign in. If you keep it "Optional", your users will have the choice whether to enable MFA or not for their account.
- **MFA methods:** You will also specify which MFA method you are using - TOTP (Time-based One-time Password), SMS (text message), or both. We recommend that you use TOTP-based MFA as it is more secure and you can reserve SMS for account recovery.

<Accordion title='Compare TOTP and SMS MFA methods' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

|  | Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) | Short Message Service (SMS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | Generates a short-lived numeric code for user authentication that includes a shared secret key and current time using an authenticator app. | Generates a one-time code shared via text message that is entered with other credentials for user authentication. |
| **Benefits** | More secure than SMS since the code is generated locally and not transmitted over a network. TOTP also works without cell service as long as the TOTP app is installed. | Easy to set up with a user-provided phone number and is familiar to users as a common authentication method. |
| **Constraints** | Requires an app to generate codes and adds to the initial setup of an account. Codes also expire quickly and must be used promptly after it is generated. | SMS requires cell service and can include an additional cost for the user. Although rare, SMS messages can also be intercepted. |

## Multi-factor authentication with SMS

<Callout info>
  If you are using the [Authenticator
  component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator)
  with Amplify (Gen 2), this feature works without any additional code. The
  guide below is for writing your own implementation.
</Callout>

Once you have setup SMS as your second layer of authentication with MFA as shown above, your users will get an authentication code via a text message to complete sign-in after they sign in with their username and password.

If you do not have one already, you will need to configure an IAM role to use with Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to manage SMS messages. You will then add this role under the "Messaging" tab for your user pool in the Amazon Cognito console. For additional information see the [_Amazon Cognito SMS text message MFA_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa-sms-text-message.html) documentation.

### Enable SMS MFA during sign-up

You will need to pass `phone_number` as a user attribute to enable SMS MFA for your users during sign-up. However, if the primary sign-in mechanism for your Cognito resource is `phone_number` (without enabling `username`), then you do not need to pass it as an attribute.

### Manage SMS MFA during sign-in

After a user signs in, if they have MFA enabled for their account, a challenge will be returned that you would need to call the `confirmSignIn` API where the user provides their confirmation code sent to their phone number.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn(username: string, password: string) {
  try {
    await signIn({ username, password });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn(username, password) {
  try {
    await signIn({ username, password });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

If MFA is **ON** or enabled for the user, you must call `confirmSignIn` with the OTP sent to their phone.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { confirmSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignInConfirmation(otpCode: string) {
  try {

    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { confirmSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignInConfirmation(otpCode) {
  try {
    await confirmSignIn({ challengeResponse: otpCode });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

After a user has been signed in, call `updateMFAPreference` to record the MFA type as enabled for the user and optionally set it as preferred so that subsequent logins default to using this MFA type.

```ts
import { updateMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleUpdateMFAPreference() {
  try {
    await updateMFAPreference({ sms: 'PREFERRED' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

## Multi-factor authentication with TOTP

<Callout info>
  If you are using the [Authenticator
  component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator)
  with Amplify (Gen 2), this feature works without any additional code. The
  guide below is for writing your own implementation.
</Callout>

You can use Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for multi-factor authentication (MFA) in your web or mobile applications. The Amplify Auth category includes support for TOTP setup and verification using authenticator apps, offering an integrated solution and enhanced security for your users. These apps, such as Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, have the TOTP algorithm built-in and work by using a shared secret key and the current time to generate short-lived, six digit passwords.

### Set up TOTP for a user

After you initiate a user sign in with the `signIn` API where a user is required to set up TOTP as an MFA method, the API call will return `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` as a challenge and next step to handle in your app. You will get that challenge if the following conditions are met:

- MFA is marked as **Required** in your user pool.
- TOTP is enabled in your user pool.
- User does not have TOTP MFA set up already.

The `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP` step signifies that the user must set up TOTP before they can sign in. The step returns an associated value of type `TOTPSetupDetails` which must be used to configure an authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. `TOTPSetupDetails` provides a helper method called `getSetupURI` which generates a URI that can be used, for example, in a button to open the user's installed authenticator app. For more advanced use cases, `TOTPSetupDetails` also contains a `sharedSecret` which can be used to either generate a QR code or be manually entered into an authenticator app.

Once the authenticator app is set up, the user can generate a TOTP code and provide it to the library to complete the sign in process.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { signIn, SignInOutput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn(username: string, password: string) {
  try {
    const output = await signIn({
      username,
      password
    });

    handleSignInNextSteps(output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

function handleSignInNextSteps(output: SignInOutput) {
  const { nextStep } = output;
  switch (nextStep.signInStep) {
    // ...
    case 'CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP':
      const totpSetupDetails = nextStep.totpSetupDetails;
      const appName = 'my_app_name';
      const setupUri = totpSetupDetails.getSetupUri(appName);
      // Open setupUri with an authenticator APP to retrieve an OTP code
      break;
    // ...
  }
}
```

import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn(username, password) {
  try {
    const output = await signIn({
      username,
      password
    });

    handleSignInNextSteps(output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

function handleSignInNextSteps(output) {
  const { nextStep } = output;
  switch (nextStep.signInStep) {
    // ...
    case 'CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_TOTP_SETUP':
      const totpSetupDetails = nextStep.totpSetupDetails;
      const appName = 'my_app_name';
      const setupUri = totpSetupDetails.getSetupUri(appName);
      // Open setupUri with an authenticator APP to retrieve an OTP code
      break;
    // ...
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

The TOTP code can be obtained from the user via a text field or any other means. Once the user provides the TOTP code, call `confirmSignIn` with the TOTP code as the `challengeResponse` parameter.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { confirmSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignInConfirmation(totpCode: string) {
  try {
    await confirmSignIn({ challengeResponse: totpCode });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { confirmSignIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignInConfirmation(totpCode) {
  try {
    await confirmSignIn({ challengeResponse: totpCode });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

After a user has been signed in, call `updateMFAPreference` to record the MFA type as enabled for the user and optionally set it as preferred so that subsequent logins default to using this MFA type.

```ts
import { updateMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleUpdateMFAPreference() {
  try {
    await updateMFAPreference({ totp: 'PREFERRED' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Enable TOTP after a user is signed in

TOTP MFA can be set up after a user has signed in. This can be done when the following conditions are met:

- MFA is marked as **Optional** or **Required** in your user pool.
- TOTP is marked as an enabled MFA method in your user pool.

TOTP can be set up by calling the `setUpTOTP` and `verifyTOTPSetup` APIs in the `Auth` category.

Invoke the `setUpTOTP` API to generate a `TOTPSetupDetails` object which should be used to configure an Authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator. `TOTPSetupDetails` provides a helper method called `getSetupURI` which generates a URI that can be used, for example, in a button to open the user's installed Authenticator app. For more advanced use cases, `TOTPSetupDetails` also contains a `sharedSecret` which can be used to either generate a QR code or be manually entered into an Authenticator app.

that contains the `sharedSecret` which will be used to either to generate a QR code or can be manually entered into an Authenticator app.

```typescript
import { setUpTOTP } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleTOTPSetup() {
  try {
    const totpSetupDetails = await setUpTOTP();
    const appName = 'my_app_name';
    const setupUri = totpSetupDetails.getSetupUri(appName);
    // Open setupUri with an authenticator APP to retrieve an OTP code
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

Once the Authenticator app is set up, the user must generate a TOTP code and provide it to the library. Pass the code to `verifyTOTPSetup` to complete the TOTP setup process.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { verifyTOTPSetup } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleTOTPVerification(totpCode: string) {
  try {
    await verifyTOTPSetup({ code: totpCode });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { verifyTOTPSetup } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleTOTPVerification(totpCode) {
  try {
    await verifyTOTPSetup({ code: totpCode });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

After TOTP setup is complete, call `updateMFAPreference` to record the MFA type as enabled for the user and optionally set it as preferred so that subsequent logins default to using this MFA type.

```ts
import { updateMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleUpdateMFAPreference() {
  try {
    await updateMFAPreference({ sms: 'ENABLED', totp: 'PREFERRED' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Recover from a lost TOTP device

<Callout warning>

If a user loses access to their TOTP device, they will need to contact an administrator to get help accessing their account. Based on the Cognito User Pool configuration, the administrator can use the [AdminSetUserMFAPreference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminSetUserMFAPreference.html) to either change the MFA preference to a different MFA method or to disable MFA for the user.

</Callout>

In a scenario where MFA is marked as "Required" in the Cognito User Pool and another MFA method is not set up, the administrator would need to first initiate an [AdminUpdateUserAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito-user-identity-pools/latest/APIReference/API_AdminUpdateUserAttributes.html) call and update the user’s phone number attribute. Once this is complete, the administrator can continue changing the MFA preference to SMS as suggested above.

## Set up a user's preferred MFA method

### Fetch the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to get the current MFA preference and enabled MFA types, if any, for the current user.

```ts
import { fetchMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleFetchMFAPreference() {
  try {
    const output = await fetchMFAPreference();
    console.log(`Enabled MFA types for the user: ${output.enabled}`);
    console.log(`Preferred MFA type for the user: ${output.preferred}`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Update the current user's MFA preferences

Invoke the following API to update the MFA preference for the current user.

<Callout warning>

Only one MFA method can be marked as preferred at a time. If the user has multiple MFA methods enabled and tries to mark more than one MFA method as preferred, the API will throw an error.

</Callout>

```ts
import { updateMFAPreference } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleUpdateMFAPreference() {
  try {
    await updateMFAPreference({ sms: 'ENABLED', totp: 'PREFERRED' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

If multiple MFA methods are enabled for the user, the `signIn` API will return `CONTINUE_SIGN_IN_WITH_MFA_SELECTION` as the next step in the auth flow. During this scenario, the user should be prompted to select the MFA method they want to use to sign in and their preference should be passed to `confirmSignIn`.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { confirmSignIn, SignInOutput } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

function handleSignInNextSteps(output: SignInOutput) {
  const { nextStep } = output;
  switch (nextStep.signInStep) {

## Remember a device

Remembering a device is useful in conjunction with MFA because it allows the second factor requirement to be automatically met when your user signs in on that device and reduces friction in their sign-in experience. By default, this feature is turned off.

<Callout>

**Note:** The [device tracking and remembering](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/tracking-and-remembering-devices-using-amazon-cognito-your-user-pools/) features are not available if any of the following conditions are met:

- the federated OAuth flow with Cognito User Pools or Hosted UI is used, or
- the User Pool uses `email/phone_number` or `alias` sign-in method, or
- when the `signIn` API uses the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` as the `authFlowType`.

</Callout>

### Configure device tracking

You can configure device tracking with `deviceTracking` construct.

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource.js';
import { data } from './data/resource.js';

const backend = defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});

const { cfnUserPool } = backend.auth.resources.cfnResources;

cfnUserPool.addPropertyOverride('DeviceConfiguration', {
  ChallengeRequiredOnNewDevice: true,
  DeviceOnlyRememberedOnUserPrompt: false
});
```

<Accordion title='Understand key terms used for tracking devices' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

There are differences to keep in mind when working with remembered, forgotten, and tracked devices.

- **Tracked:** Every time the user signs in with a new device, the client is given the device key at the end of a successful authentication event. We use this device key to generate a salt and password verifier which is used to call the `ConfirmDevice` API. At this point, the device is considered to be "tracked". Once the device is in a tracked state, you can use the Amazon Cognito console to see the time it started to be tracked, last authentication time, and other information about that device.
- **Remembered:** Remembered devices are also tracked. During user authentication, the device key and secret pair assigned to a remembered device is used to authenticate the device to verify that it is the same device that the user previously used to sign in.
- **Not Remembered:** A not-remembered device is a tracked device where Cognito has been configured to require users to "Opt-in" to remember a device but the user has chosen not to remember the device. This use case is for users signing into their application from a device that they don't own.
- **Forgotten:** In the event that you no longer want to remember or track devices, you can use the `forgetDevice()` API to remove devices from being both remembered and tracked.

</Accordion>

### Remember devices

You can remember devices using the following:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { rememberDevice } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

export async function handleRememberDevice() {
  try {
    await rememberDevice();

  try {
    await rememberDevice();
  } catch (error) {

  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

#### Forget devices

You can also forget devices but note that forgotten devices are still tracked.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { forgetDevice } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

  }
}
```

</Block>

#### Fetch devices

You can fetch a list of remembered devices by using the following:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { fetchDevices } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

export async function handleFetchDevices() {
  try {
    const output = await fetchDevices();
    console.log(output);

    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { fetchDevices } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleFetchDevices() {
  try {
    const output = await Auth.fetchDevices();
    console.log(output);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

You can now set up devices to be remembered, forgotten, and fetched.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Manage MFA settings** guide. In this guide, you set up and configured MFA for your users and provided them options on remembering their MFA preferences and devices.

### Next steps

Now that you completed setting up multi-factor authentication you may also want to add additional customization. We recommend you learn more about:

- [Listen to auth events](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/auth-events/)
- [Set up admin actions and user group management](/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/admin-actions/)
