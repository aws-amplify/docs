You can enable your users to sign-in and authenticate with your app using their existing accounts with social providers like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google. Once you configure your backend resources, you can then configure your app to sign in users for that provider. This process will securely exchange credentials and gather user information. This information can then be used to create a new user in your app or link the social account to an existing user. Incorporating social provider sign-in provides your users with a streamlined registration, more sign-in options, and an integrated experience across their existing accounts and your app.

In this guide we will review how you can add sign-in with social providers by first setting up your developer account with the provider. After this step, you can then configure your Auth category and integrate social sign-in with your app.

Before you begin, you will need:

- An Amplify project
- The Amplify libraries installed and configured

<Accordion title='Review how OAuth authentication works' headingLevel='3' eyebrow='Learn more'>

The preferred way to incorporate social provider sign-in is via an OAuth redirect which lets users sign in using their social media account and creates a corresponding user in the Cognito User Pool.

[OAuth 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) is the common Authorization framework used by web and mobile applications for accessing user information ("scopes") in a limited manner. Common analogies you will hear in OAuth is that of boarding a plane or staying in a hotel - showing your identification is the authentication piece (signing into an app) and using the boarding pass/hotel key is what you are authorized to access.

OAuth support in Amplify uses Cognito User Pools and supports federation with social providers, which will automatically create a corresponding user in the User Pool after they sign in. With this design you do not need to include an SDK for the social provider in your app. After you set up your developer account with these social providers you can configure the `Auth` category by running `amplify add auth` and selecting the social provider option. You can then use `signInWithRedirect()` in your app to either show a pre-built "Hosted UI" or pass in a provider name (e.g. `signInWithRedirect({provider:'Facebook'})`) to interface directly and build your own UI. ![Image](/images/SocialAuthZ.png)

</Accordion>

## Set up your social auth provider

Before you configure social sign-in with Amplify Auth you will need to set up your developer account with each provider you are using.

Your developer accounts with the social providers are now set up and you can return to your Amplify project for next steps.

## Configure the Auth category

Once you have the social providers configured you can update your Auth configuration through the Amplify CLI.

<Callout warning>

When configuring social sign-in through the Amplify CLI, it's important to exercise caution when designating attributes as "required". Each social identity provider has different information they send back to Cognito. User Pool attributes that are initially set up as "required" cannot be changed later. You may have to migrate the users or create a new User Pool if you need to change requirements.

</Callout>

To begin with the CLI, run the following in your projectâ€™s root folder:

```bash
amplify add auth     ## "amplify update auth" if already configured
```

Choose the following options:

```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration with Social Provider (Federation)`

You have configured your Auth category and updated your URL with the social providers. You can now set up the frontend for your app.

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>

## Install native module

`signInWithRedirect` displays the sign-in UI inside a platform-dependent webview. On iOS devices, an [ASWebAuthenticationSession](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession) will be launched and, on Android, a [Custom Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/). After the sign-in process is complete, the sign-in UI will redirect back to your app.

To enable this capability, an additional dependency must be installed.

```sh
npm install @aws-amplify/rtn-web-browser
```

## Platform Setup

<Callout>On iOS, there should be no additional setup steps.</Callout>

### Android

After a successful sign-in, the sign-in UI will attempt to redirect back to your application. To register the redirect URI scheme you configured above with the device, an `intent-filter` must be added to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file which should be located in your React Native app's `android/app/src/main` directory.

Add the `intent-filter` to your application's main activity, replacing `myapp` with your redirect URI scheme as necessary.

```xml
<application ...>
    <activity android:name=".MainActivity" ...>
        ...
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
            <data android:scheme="myapp" />
        </intent-filter>
        ...
    </activity>
</application>
```

</InlineFilter>

## Set up your frontend

After configuring the OAuth endpoints (with Cognito Hosted UI), you can integrate your app by invoking the `signInWithRedirect` function which will redirect the user to the Cognito Hosted UI and provide options to sign in via username and password as well as any of the Social providers you have configured. Also, note that passing `Amazon`, `Apple`, `Facebook` or `Google` on the `provider` argument (e.g `signInWithRedirect({ provider: 'Amazon' })`) will bypass the Hosted UI and federate immediately with the social provider as shown in the below example.

### Add custom state

A custom state is not required, but if you are looking to add one, you are able to do so by passing a string value (e.g. `signInWithRedirect({ customState: 'xyz' })`) and listening for the custom state via [Hub](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/utilities/hub/). You can also use the Hub eventing system to catch errors using `signInWithRedirect()` to listen for the `signInWithRedirect_failure` event.

### Redirect URLs

_Sign in_ & _Sign out_ redirect URL(s) are used to redirect end users after the sign in or sign out operation has occurred. You may want to specify multiple URLs for various use-cases such as having different URLs for development/ production or redirect users to an intermediate URL before returning them to the app. 

#### Specifying a redirect URL on sign out
If you have multiple sign out redirect URLs configured, you may choose to override the default behavior of selecting a redirect URL and provide the one of your choosing when calling `signOut`. The provided redirect URL should match at least one of the configured redirect URLs. If no redirect URL is provided to `signOut`, the first item from the the configured redirect URLs list that does not contain a HTTP nor HTTPS prefix will be picked.

```ts
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

// Assuming the following URLS were provided manually or via the Amplify configuration file,
// redirectSignOut: 'myDevApp://,https://authProvider/logout/?logout_uri=myDevApp://'

signOut({
  global: false,
  oauth: {
    redirectUrl: 'https://authProvider/logout/?logout_uri=myDevApp://'
  }
});


```
<Callout> Irrespective of whether a `redirectUrl` is provided to `signOut`, a URL that does not contain http or https is expected to be present in the configured redirect URL list. This is because iOS requires an appScheme when creating the web session. </Callout>

### Redirect URLs

_Sign in_ & _Sign out_ redirect URL(s) are used to redirect end users after the sign in or sign out operation has occurred. You may want to specify multiple URLs for various use-cases such as having different URLs for development (`http://localhost:3000/`) production (`https://www.example.com/`) or redirect users to an intermediate URL before returning them to the app.

#### Specifying a redirect URL on sign out
If you have multiple redirect URLs configured, you may choose to override the default behavior of selecting a redirect URL and provide the one of your choosing when calling `signOut`. The provided redirect URL should match at least one of the configured redirect URLs. If no redirect URL is provided to `signOut`, one will be selected based on the current app domain.

```ts
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

// Assuming the following URLS were provided manually or via the Amplify configuration file,
// redirectSignOut: 'http://localhost:3000/,https://www.example.com/'

signOut({
  global: false,
  oauth: {
    redirectUrl: 'https://www.example.com/'
  }
});

```

### (Required for Multi-Page Applications) Complete Social Sign In after Redirect

If you are developing a multi-page application, and the redirected page is not the same page that initiated the sign in, you will need to add the following code to the redirected page to ensure the sign in gets completed:

```ts
import 'aws-amplify/auth/enable-oauth-listener';
```

<Callout>

**NOTE:** The listener only works on the client side in the context of a SSR-enabled project, so ensure to import the listener on the client side only. For example, in a Next.js project, you should add the above import statement to a component that renders on the client side only by `'use client'`.

</Callout>

<Accordion eyebrow="Under the hood" headingLevel="4" title="Why Social Sign In needs to be explicitly handled for Multi-Page Applications">
	
When you import and use the `signInWithRedirect` function, it will add a listener as a side effect that will complete the social sign in when an end user is redirected back to your app. This works well in a single-page application but in a multi-page application, you might get redirected to a page that doesn't include the listener that was originally added as a side-effect. Hence you must include the specific OAuth listener on your login success page.
	
</Accordion>

</InlineFilter>

### Custom Providers

When using custom providers that are not provided by default in Cognito, you can pass an object to the `provider` parameter with the name of your custom provider.

```javascript
import { signInWithRedirect } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

const provider = {
  custom: 'MyCustomOIDCProvider'
}

function handleSignInClick() {
    signInWithRedirect({ provider })
}
```

### Deploy your backend environment with auth parameters for social sign-in

When you create or update your authentication configuration, Amplify will setup the configuration locally, but it does not automatically deploy the changes to your backend environment. You will need to run `amplify push` to deploy the changes to your backed environment.

<InlineFilter filters={["javascript", "angular", "nextjs", "react", "vue"]}>

You can deploy your app to the Amplify Console with continuous deployment of the frontend and backend, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/environment-variables.html#creating-a-new-backend-environment-with-authentication-parameters).

</InlineFilter>

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Add social provider sign-in** guide. In this guide, you learned how to set up your social auth provider, configure the Amplify Auth category for social sign-in, and set up the frontend. Your users can now sign into your app using their social provider accounts.

## Next steps

Now that you have social provider sign-in you may also want to learn additional ways to customize these workflows. We recommend you learn more about:
