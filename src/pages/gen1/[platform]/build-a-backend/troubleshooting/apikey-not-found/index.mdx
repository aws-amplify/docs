If you're encountering an "API Key Not Found" issue in your Amplify project, follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

## Step 1: Modify `parameters.json` to Remove API Key

1. Navigate to the `amplify/backend/api/<apiName>/parameters.json` file in your project.
2. Add the following line to the file:

  ```json title="parameters.json"
  {
        "CreateAPIKey": 0
  }
  ```      
  Ensure that a comma is placed after the previous line if this is added at the end of the JSON object.  

## Step 2: Remove API Key from Lambda Function Attributes

1. Open the `amplify/backend/backend-config.json` file.
2. Locate any JSON attribute arrays that include `GraphQLAPIKeyOutput`.
3. Modify the arrays by removing the `GraphQLAPIKeyOutput` entry. For example:

  * Change this:

    ```json title="backend-config.json"
    {
      "attributes": [
          "GraphQLAPIIdOutput",
          "GraphQLAPIEndpointOutput",
          "GraphQLAPIKeyOutput"
      ]
    }
    ```

  * To this:

    ```json title="backend-config.json"
    {
      "attributes": [
          "GraphQLAPIIdOutput",
          "GraphQLAPIEndpointOutput"
      ]
    }
    ```
    Perform this change for each Lambda function that utilizes the API.


## Step 3: Apply the Changes

1. Push the changes to the cloud:

  ```sh
  amplify push -y
  ```
  Once this process is complete, the API key should be removed from both the application and the associated Lambda functions.

## Step 4: Restore the API Key

1. Remove the `CreateAPIKey: 0` entry from `amplify/backend/api/<apiName>/parameters.json`.
2. Push the changes to restore the API key to the application:

  ```sh
  amplify push -y
  ```
  After this step, the API key should be restored to the application but will not be associated with the Lambda functions.


## Step 5: Update Lambda Function Resources

1. Use the following command to update each Lambda function that was previously associated with the API:

  ```sh
  amplify update function
  ```
2. Follow the prompts to remove the API from the Lambda’s resources.
3. Use the same command to restore the API to each Lambda function:

  ```sh
  amplify update function
  ```
4. Finally, push the changes to apply them:

  ```sh
  amplify push -y
  ```
  This should complete the process and resolve the "API Key Not Found" issue.
