## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the below steps:

- [Completed the CLI and project setup steps.](/gen1/[platform]/start/project-setup/prerequisites/)

## Provision backend storage

AWS Amplify Storage module provides a simple mechanism for managing user content for your app in public, protected or private storage buckets. The Storage category comes with built-in support for Amazon S3.

To start provisioning storage resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add storage
```

Enter the following when prompted:

```console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
    `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now?
    `Yes`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the project:
    `S3friendlyName`
? Please provide bucket name:
    `storagebucketname`
? Who should have access:
    `Auth and guest users`
? What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? What kind of access do you want for Guest users?
    `create/update, read, delete`
? Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket?
    `No`
```

To push your changes to the cloud, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify push
```

When your backend is successfully updated, your new configuration file `amplifyconfiguration.json` is copied under your source directory, e.g. '/src'.

### Configure your application

Add Amplify to your app with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

import js0 from '/src/fragments/lib/common/js/import_configuration.mdx';

<Fragments
  fragments={{
    javascript: js0,
    angular: js0,
    nextjs: js0,
    react: js0,
    vue: js0
  }}
/>

```typescript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the [Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/library-not-configured/) for possible causes of this issue.

</Callout>

## Mocking and Local Testing with Amplify CLI

Amplify CLI supports running a local mock server for testing your application with Amazon S3. Please see the [CLI toolchain documentation](/gen1/[platform]/tools/cli/usage/mock/) for more details.
