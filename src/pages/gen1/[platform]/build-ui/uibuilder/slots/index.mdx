Component slots allow you to nest other components as React code within your Studio-generated UI components. You can use component slots to create dynamically generated child components, like Comments on a Post, or to replace a child element altogether.

## Adding a component slot

First, you'll need a component.

1. [Launch Studio](/[platform]/tools/console/adminui/start/#log-into-the-amplify-console) for an app.

2. On the left-hand navigation bar, click UI Library

3. Select a Figma component from your UI Library that you've imported into Studio. _If you don't have any Figma components already, you can start with [Amplify's Figma UI file](/[platform]/build-ui/uibuilder/)._

4. Configure that component by clicking the **Configure** button in the upper right-hand corner.

Next, you'll add a component slot to this component.

1. On the left-hand side, you'll see the elements of your component. Select a Figma **Frame** (![Figma frame icon](/images/console/figma-frame-icon.png)) within your component.

In this example, the "Area" frame is selected.

2. On the right-hand panel, click the "Convert to a slot" button. This will add a new prop to your UI component. Any JSX element you pass into that prop will be rendered in the generated component slot.

3. Optionally, change your property name.

In this example, the property has been renamed "comments"

<Callout warning>

Want to undo your component slot creation?

<br />
Locate your component slot in the **Component properties** (top-right corner), choose
the triple-dot menu, and select **Erase property** to remove the component slot.

## Using a component slot

### Importing your component

Once you've added a component slot to your component, click the **Get component code** button at the bottom of the screen to see instructions on the next steps.

1. Copy the `amplify pull` command, and run it in your Terminal
2. Copy the import code and paste it in your React app code
3. Lastly, render the component

```jsx
/*Import your component*/
import { Ampligram } from './ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    /*Add your component below*/
    <Ampligram />
  );
}
export default App;
```

Here's how the code above would render in your app. _Some minor styling has been added to help with visibility._

### Using your component slot to replace individual child components

To use the component slot, pass a child component as a property of the parent component, using the prop name you picked earlier. Then, the content you pass will be rendered as a child of the component.

```jsx
import { Ampligram } from '.ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <Ampligram
      style={styles.post}
      comments={
        //Pass your content into the component slot
        <div>
          <h1>Hi mom!</h1>
          <p>Thanks for checking out my app</p>
        </div>
      }
    />
  );
}
export default App;
```

Here's how the code above would render in your app.

### Adding component slots to collections

Any component can be bound to data and used to [generate to a collection](/[platform]/build-ui/uibuilder/collections/), including components with component slots. Studio supports data binding to any GraphQL API created with Amplify, [with and without DataStore](/[platform]/tools/console/data/data-model/#datastore-and-graphql).

<Callout note>

{' '}

<strong>Limitation: Nested data fetching for many-to-many relationships</strong>
<br />
Automatic nested data fetching for many-to-many relationships is currently not
supported. Component slots only automatically fetch data for [has
One](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#has-one-relationship)
and [has Many
relationships](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/data-modeling/#has-many-relationship),
like one Post to many Comments.

</Callout>

Here, the Ampligram collection is mapped to a data model called `Post`. The `Post` model has a one-to-many relationship with the `Comment` model, so each `Post` can have many `Comment`s. The AmpligramCollection below will render an Ampligram for each record in the `Post` model. Then, each related `Comment` will render in the `comments` component slot.

In this example, the first Post has 2 comments, but the second post has none.

```jsx
import { AmpligramCollection } from './ui-components';

function App() {
  return (
    <AmpligramCollection
      overrideItems={({ item }) => ({
        //Populate the "comments" slot
        comments: (
          <div>
            {/*Map each related comment into a div*/}
            {item.Comments.map((comment) => (
              <div>{comment.content}</div>
            ))}
          </div>
        )
      })}
    />
  );
}
export default App;
```

![Screenshot of component with dynamic content in the component slot](/images/console/slots3.png)

Dynamically rendering child components is where component slots get very useful - you can even [pass another collection](/[platform]/build-ui/uibuilder/override/#nesting-collections) into this component slot.
