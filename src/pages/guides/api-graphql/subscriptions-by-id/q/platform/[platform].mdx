In this guide you will learn how to create a custom GraphQL subscription that will only by connected and triggered by a mutation containing a specific ID as an argument.

When using the Amplify GraphQL transform library, there will often be times when you need to expand the GraphQL schema and operations created by the `@model` directive. A common use case is when fine grained control is needed for GraphQL subscriptions.

import ios0 from "/src/fragments/guides/api-graphql/ios/subscriptions-by-id.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios0}} />

import js1 from "/src/fragments/guides/api-graphql/js/subscriptions-by-id.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js1}} />

import android2 from "/src/fragments/guides/api-graphql/android/subscriptions-by-id.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android2}} />

import flutter3 from "/src/fragments/guides/api-graphql/flutter/subscriptions-by-id.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter3}} />
