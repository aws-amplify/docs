In this guide you will learn how to implement pagination in your GraphQL API.

When working with a large record set, you may want to only fetch the first __N__ number of items. For example, let's start with a basic GraphQL schema for a Todo app:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String 
}
```

When the API is created with an `@model` directive, the following queries will automatically be created for you:

```graphql
type Query {
  getTodo(id: ID!): Todo
  listTodos(filter: ModelTodoFilterInput, limit: Int, nextToken: String): ModelTodoConnection
}
```

Next, take a look at the `ModelTodoConnection` type to get an idea of the data that will be returned when the `listTodos` query is run:

```graphql
type ModelTodoConnection {
  items: [Todo]
  nextToken: String
}
```

When querying the API using the `listTodos` query, the return type will be of `ModelTodoConnection`, meaning you can return both an array of `Todos` and a `nextToken`.

The `nextToken` is what is used to handle pagination. If the `nextToken` is `null`, that means that there is no more data to return from the API. If the `nextToken` is present, you can use the value as an argument to the next `listTodos` query to return the next selection set from the API.

To test this out, try creating 5 todos using a mutation like this:

```sh
mutation createTodo {
  createTodo(input: {
    title: "Todo 1"
    description: "My first todo"
  }) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

Next, you can set the limit of the number of todos in a query by passing in a `limit` argument. In this query, you'll set the limit to 2 items and request a `nextToken` as a return value:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

 Now, to query the next 2 items from the API, you can pass this `nextToken` as the argument:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2, nextToken: <your_token>) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

When there are no other items left to be returned, the `nextToken` in the response will be set to null.
