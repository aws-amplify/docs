};

In this guide you will learn how to run a GraphQL server in a Lambda function. In this example we will be using [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) and [Apollo Server Lambda](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/master/packages/apollo-server-lambda), but you can use any server implementation you would like.

The end goal is to have an API endpoint, like `https://your-api-endpoint.com/graphql`, deployed and integrated with a GraphQL server running in a serverless function.

### Creating the Amplify project

To get started, create a new Amplify project.

<Callout>

If you already have an Amplify project created, you can jump to the next step - Creating the GraphQL API and function

</Callout>

```sh
amplify init

# Choose your environment name and default text editor
# You can answer the defaults for the rest of the questions and then choose the profile you created when you ran amplify configure
```

### Creating the GraphQL API and function

Next we need to create the API and the Lambda function. Using the `api` category, the CLI will create a serverless function as well as an http endpoint that we can use for our GraphQL server.

```sh
$ amplify add api

? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: REST
? Provide a friendly name for your resource to be used as a label for this category in the project: apolloapi
? Provide a path (e.g., /items): /graphql
? Choose a Lambda source: Create a new Lambda function
? Provide a friendly name for your resource to be used as a label for this category in the project: apolloserver
? Provide the AWS Lambda function name: apolloserver
? Choose the function runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: Hello World
? Do you want to access other resources created in this project from your Lambda function? N
? Do you want to edit the local lambda function now? N
? Restrict API access: N
? Do you want to add another path? N
```

#### Installing the dependencies

Change into the folder of the Lambda function and install the following dependencies:

```sh
cd amplify/backend/function/apolloserver/src
npm install apollo-server-lambda graphql
cd ../../../../../
```

### Function code

Now, let's open the code for the function.

Open __amplify/backend/function/apolloserver/src/index.js__. Here, you will see the main function handler. Update the function with the following code:

```javascript
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server-lambda');

/* Construct a schema, using GraphQL schema language */
const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query { hello: String }
`

/* Provide resolver functions for your schema fields */
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello from Apollo!!',
  },
}

const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    context: ({ event, context }) => ({
      headers: event.headers,
      functionName: context.functionName,
      event,
      context,
    }),
  })
  
exports.handler = server.createHandler({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
    credentials: true,
  }
})
```

Now, we can deploy the function and GraphQL API:

```sh
amplify push
```

Now the API is deployed and you should be able to start interacting with it.

### API URL

Once the server is up and running, The url is available in the aws-exports.js file. The final GraphQL endpoint will look something like this:

```
https://6dbg37jfw5.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<env-name>/graphql
```

You can also use the GraphQL playground by navigating to the GraphQL endpoint `/graphql` directly in your browser.
