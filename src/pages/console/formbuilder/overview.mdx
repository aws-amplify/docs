};

Amplify Studio's Form Builder automatically generates cloud-connected forms as React code, either from your data model, any JSON object, or from scratch. You can configure validation logic, adjust theming, and customize presentation all within the console. 

Forms are also extensible, allowing full form lifecycle management, and supporting custom validation logic in code, including calling an external API or validating against another database.

## Option 1: Use auto-generated forms

The fastest and easiest way to use the Form Builder is to use forms generated from your data model. To auto-generate forms:

1. Deploy a [Data model](/console/data/data-model/) in [Amplify Studio](/console/adminui/start/#logging-in-and-creating-an-app)
2. Navigate to the **Studio Console > UI Library**

Your forms will be listed on the left-hand navigation bar under the **Forms** header

<Callout info>

**Missing a form?** If you have a deployed data model but have no forms, automatic form generation may be disabled. In the upper right-hand corner of the UI Library, select **UI Library settings**, and enable **Automatic form creation**.

</Callout>

For each data model, Amplify Studio will generate two forms: a **Create** form, and an **Update** form. 

Your forms will contain inputs for each field of your data model. Auto-generated forms are dynamic; as your data model changes, the forms' fields will update accordingly.

## Option 2: Build a form from scratch

Alternatively, Amplify Studio allows you to build forms completely from scratch. To generate a basic, brand-new form:

1. Navigate to **[Amplify Studio Console](/console/adminui/start/#logging-in-and-creating-an-app) > UI Library**
2. In the left-hand nav bar, next to the **Forms** header, select **New**
3. Give your form a name
4. For this example, leave the other options as default, and click **Create form**

After clicking **Create form**, you will be directed to the Edit Form page. Select the **plus sign**, and select an input element to add to your form.

Alternatively, you can select different options when generating your form:
- Forms created as **Update** forms will expect input data
- Forms that start with a **Data model** will have an input element for every field on the data model, similar to an auto-generated form

## Option 3: Generate a form from any JSON object

Amplify Studio can generate a form based on the JSON object you'd like it to produce. This is particularly useful if you are interfacing with another API - most API endpoints expect input data in JSON format, so you can quickly generate a form by pasting a sample payload. 

To generate a form from JSON:
1. Navigate to **[Amplify Studio Console](/console/adminui/start/#logging-in-and-creating-an-app) > UI Library**
2. In the left-hand nav bar, next to the **Forms** header, select **New**
3. In the New Form page, select **JSON object**
4. Paste your JSON into the code editor
5. Give your form a name, and click **Create form**

Form Builder will infer the input element type based on the value and can handle arrays and nested JSON values. For example, use this JSON sample:

```json
{
  "basics": {
    "firstName": "Wesley",
    "emailAddress": "wpeck@amazon.com"
  },
  "favoriteThings": {
    "animals": ["Cats", "Snakes", "Quokka"],
    "month": "December",
    "number": 17
  },
  "active": true,
  "enabled": false
}
```

This JSON will render the following form:

From the JSON object, Amplify Studio can automatically
- set the correct types for **Email address** and **Number**
- set **Animals** to receive multiple values
- set **Active** and **Enabled** to switches

## Render React form in your app

### Initial Project Setup

To use a form in your application, you first need to configure your project to use Amplify Studio generated components. 

1. Navigate to your application's root directory and install the following npm dependencies

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

2. In your application's `index.js` file, add the following imports and configuration

```jsx
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import {ThemeProvider} from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";

import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
import studioTheme from './ui-components/studioTheme';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```
3. In your application's `index.js` file, wrap the `<App />` with the following:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={studioTheme}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

### Import and Render Your Form

Next, your forms need to be pulled from the Amplify cloud to your project, and imported into your code. 

1. Navigate to your application's root directory and run `amplify pull`
2. Import your form by name. For a form named `ProductCreateForm`, you would use the following code:

```jsx

import { 
  ProductCreateForm 
} from './ui-components';

```

3. Place your form in code. For a form named `ProductCreateForm`, you would use `<ProductCreateForm />` to render the form
