Collections are any list of repeating items. You can visually create a collection from any individual component by selecting the **Create collection** button in the top right corner of the UI component editor. All collections are generated as code with real-time subscriptions automatically set up.

## Data binding

Amplify Studio offers a visual way to bind collections to items in your data model. Collection items can be filtered, sorted, or linked to specific records from the content management view.

### GraphQL and DataStore

Amplify Studio supports data binding to all Amplify GraphQL APIs, **with or without DataStore**. [Learn more about DataStore and Conflict Resolution here](/console/data/data-model/#datastore-and-graphql). 

For APIs without DataStore, there are some minor Collection feature limitations: 
- Collections cannot be [Sorted](#set-sort-conditions)
- Collections have limited [Search](#set-search-and-pagination)
- Collections have limited [Pagination](#set-search-and-pagination)

Additionally, if your data has any relationships, APIs without DataStore require a query depth of 4 or greater. To update your codegen query depth:
1. Navigate to the root directory of your project in your terminal
1. Run `amplify configure codegen`
1. When prompted, set query depth to 4 or greater. All other options can be set to your preference
1. Run `amplify codegen` to generate queries with your new depth

### Tutorial

1. Launch [Amplify Studio](/console/adminui/start/#logging-in-and-creating-an-app) for an app
2. Create a [collection](/console/tutorial/collections/) from a component
3. Link collection to a data model
4. Set filters to customize what data should be displayed
5. Set sort conditions to customize how the data should be displayed
   > **Note:** If your component doesn't have a property backed by a data model, then you need to manually map a component's property to a designated data model field.

### Set filters

Filters control what records are displayed in a collection. You can add multiple filters to a single collection.

### Set sort conditions

Sort conditions control the direction records are displayed in a collection.

<Callout warning>

Collections bound to an GraphQL API without DataStore cannot be sorted. [Learn more about DataStore and Conflict Resolution](/console/data/data-model/#datastore-and-graphql)

## Edit layout

You can edit some of the Amplify UI [collection properties](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components/collection) directly in Studio. Changes to the layout properties (e.g. List vs. grid, direction, order, padding) are reflected in the real-time preview.

## Set Search and Pagination

### Search

Collections can be configured to automatically include a search bar by selecting the **Include** link on the left-hand bar. You can customize the placeholder for the search bar, and test it in-browser.

<Callout warning>

Collections bound to GraphQL APIs without DataStore have limited Search capabilities. [Learn more about DataStore and Conflict Resolution](/console/data/data-model/#datastore-and-graphql)

</Callout>

### Pagination

Collections can be configured to automatically paginate, with a specific number of items per page. Select **Include** on the left-hand bar to enable pagination and set the number of items. 

![Screenshot showing pagination](/images/console/ui-collections-pagination.png)

For collections bound to GraphQL APIs without DataStore, pagination has limited support. Users can step forward through pages (e.g. page 1 to page 2), but cannot skip pages (e.g. page 1 to page 3).
