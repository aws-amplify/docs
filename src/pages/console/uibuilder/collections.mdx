Collections are any list of repeating items. You can visually create a collection from any individual component by selecting the **Create collection** button in the top right corner of the UI component editor. All collections are generated as code with real-time subscriptions automatically set up.

## Data binding

Amplify Studio offers a visual way to bind collections to items in your data model. Collection items can be filtered, sorted, or linked to specific records from the content management view.

1. Create a collection from a component
2. Link collection to a data model
3. Define a data set with either a dynamic query or specific records.
4. Components that already have data model bindings, automatically map data to child elements. For components that do not have data model bindings,

### Dynamic query

A dynamic query allows you to sort and filter data from the content view to show relevant data.

### Specific records

Link the collection to specific items in your database.

## Edit layout

You can edit some of the Amplify UI [collection properties](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/components/collection) directly in Studio. Changes to the layout properties (e.g. List vs. grid, direction, order, padding) are reflected in the real-time preview.
