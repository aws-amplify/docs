You can use Amplify Studio to dynamically toggle between different component variants based on your app's breakpoint. For example, you can have the navigation bar shrink to a smaller size as the window gets smaller.

## 1. Set your preferred breakpoints in Figma

By default, all Amplify UI provides the following [breakpoints as part of the Amplify UI theme](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/theming/responsive#breakpoints):

```
{
  base: '0',
  small: '480px',
  medium: '768px',
  large: '992px',
  xl: '1280px',
  xxl: '1536px',
}
```

Breakpoints are set at the Theme level, which means they apply to all components in your Figma file.  You can customize these breakpoints in the Amplify Theme Editor plugin:
1. Right click in your Figma project and select "Plugins" > "AWS Amplify Theme Editor" (screenshot)
2. Select the "Breakpoints" Tab
(screenshot)
3. Click on any breakpoint to customize the pixel value

## 2. Configure your Figma variants

To make your components responsive, you first need a component with variants.  [Learn more about creating variants in Figma's documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061175334-Create-interactive-components-with-variants).

<Callout warning>

**IMPORTANT:** The variants are required to have the same component structure. If the variants don't have the same child elements, then Amplify Studio will not be able to import the component.

To customize child elements in variants, you can use the eye icon to hide and show elements in different variants.

</Callout>

When you generate a component with variants in Figma, a Property will be created and assigned to each variant.  Make the following configurations to your component:
1. Change the component property name to `breakpoint`
(screenshot)
2. For each variant, set `breakpoint`'s value to one of the supported values (e.g. `small`, `xl`, etc)
(screenshot)


## 3. Render and test your component

With your design complete in Figma, import and render your component using Amplify Studio UI Builder:
1. [Sync your Figma file with UI Builder](figmatocode/)
2. In your local project, run `amplify pull`
3. Import and render your new React component in code
4. Resize the window - your component will change automatically based on the breakpoints you set before
