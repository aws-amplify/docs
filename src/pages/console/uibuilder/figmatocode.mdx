};

Amplify Studio offers an integration with Figma, allowing you to generate clean React code by importing your Figma design file. [Figma](https://figma.com/) is a browser-based UI and UX design application that is used to build high-fidelity designs. In the standard product development lifecycle, UI or UX designers build mockups that get implemented as code by developers. Amplify Studio automatically converts any [Figma component](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Guide-to-Components-in-Figma) in your Figma file to a [React component](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) that is then usable in your app.

## Step 1: Set up Figma file

To get started, all you have to do is link your Amplify Studio project to a Figma file. While you can link any Figma file to Studio, for the best end to end experience, we recommend starting with our Figma file. To get started from scratch, **[duplicate our Figma UI file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047600760128127424)**.

![figma](/images/console/ui-figma-file.png)

This file contains the following pages:

- **README**: The README page explains how to use the Figma file to create new components, theme primitives, and customize layout and styling.
- **Primitives**: Primitives are building-block components such as alerts, buttons, and badges. These primitives correspond to the [Amplify UI primitives](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/components) and get exported to code with all the primitive properties.
- **My components**: This page contains all of the custom components built using the primitives. Amplify provides dozens of components such as news feed, social media, and marketing hero components to get you started. Customize these to match your needs or build your own components.
- **Examples**: This is for demonstration purposes only, to show designers how to use our components to build entire pages.

Please follow the README in our Figma file to learn how to create your components to optimize for code quality.

## Step 2: Link Figma file in Studio

In [Amplify Studio](/console/adminui/start/#logging-in-and-creating-an-app), enter the URL for the Figma file you just created (or duplicated). You will be asked to authenticate with Figma.

![figma](/images/console/ui-figma-to-studio.png)

After authenticating with Figma, you will see a list of components that you can sync. Choose **Accept all** to import all components, or walkthrough them one-by-one to make sure they are visually acceptable. Once you complete the sync, you should see a list of components that have been imported. All previews of the components are live renders of the actual coded components. Open your dev tools inspector to check it out!

## Step 3: Configure your project

Before importing and using your components and theme, the project will need an initial setup. To get started, create a [new React App](/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/#create-a-new-react-app) then,

1. Navigate to your application root directory and install the following npm dependencies. 

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

2. In your application's entrypoint file (e.g. `src/index.js` for create-react-app or `src/main.jsx` for Vite), add the following imports and configuration

```jsx
import {ThemeProvider} from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";
import studioTheme from './ui-components/studioTheme';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```
3. In your application's entrypoint file (e.g. `src/index.js` for create-react-app or `src/main.jsx` for Vite), wrap the `<App />` with the following:

```jsx
<ThemeProvider theme={studioTheme}>
    <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```


Alternatively, initial project setup instructions can be found at any time within any component. In Studio, pick a component and choose **Configure** to get to the component editor screen. Choose **Get component code** at the bottom of the page.

![A component in edit mode with the Get component code button visible at the bottom](/images/studio/ui-setup1.png)

Go to the **Initial project setup** tab and follow the setup instructions.

![A pop up with the Initial Project Setup tab selected, showing code snippets needed to use Amplify Studio components](/images/studio/ui-setup2.png)

## Step 4: Import and render your components

Navigate to the root directory of your project. In the project root directory, run `amplify pull` to import React code generated from your Figma components. Then, import your components to use them in your application. Replace "ComponentA" and "ComponentB" with the names of your components:
```jsx
import { ComponentA, ComponentB }  from './ui-components';

```

Amplify CLI places all generated UI component code in the `src/ui-components` directory as JSX and TS files. All generated code is built with primitives from the Amplify UI library. 

Although you can inspect the component code, any changes to component code will be overwritten on the next `amplify pull`. Instead, you can update the source component in Figma and resync, or you can use overrides to customize individual components inline. **[Learn how to extend your components with code here](/console/uibuilder/override)**.



## Upgrading Figma files

In order to upgrade your Figma file, the newest version of all Amplify UI primitives must be imported into your customized Figma file.

1. Duplicate the new [Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047600760128127424) into your Figma account.
![Duplicate the new figma file](/images/console/ui-figma-file.png)
1. Copy everything in the **README** page of the cloned community file into your existing customized Figma file
    * If your Figma file doesn't have a **README** page, create new page named **README**
1. Delete all content in the **Primitives** page of your customized Figma file
1. Copy everything in the **Primitives** page of the cloned Figma file, and paste it into the **Primitives** page of your customized Figma file.
1. Go through each component on the **My Components** page and update the broken component instances to point to the local components on the **Primitives** page. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to bulk update component instances in Figma.
![Reattach figma components](/images/console/figma-upgrade-reattach.gif)

**It is important to reattach your primitives. If you skip this step, Amplify Studio will generate components that look correct, but the React code generated will not use the [Amplify UI components](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws), and may not behave as expected**

<Callout info>

Having trouble identifying which primitives need to be reattached? Amplify Studio will warn you during import if a primitive is broken.

### Figma file changelog

#### 1.2.0: July 25 2022

* Update supported Amplify UI React version to 3.1.0.
* Add TextAreaField primitive component. You can change any existing TextField into a TextAreaField by selecting the desired TextField instance and choosing "TextAreaField" under the Swap Instance dropdown.
![Convert TextField to TextArea](/images/console/ui-figma-textfield-to-textarea.gif)

#### 1.0.0: March 2 2022

* Fixing primitive component layer names to map properly to React props.
* Removing the Icon primitive and adding a custom Icon component. This change allows for easier icon customization.
* Fixing visual discrepancies between Figma file and React components.
* Re-organizing primitive component variants to make the default variant more expected. For example, default size and default variation of the button instead of the primary variation.
* Adding version number to the Figma file

### Limitations

Components created with UI Builder are currently not compatible with React Server Components, including the Next.js App Router.
