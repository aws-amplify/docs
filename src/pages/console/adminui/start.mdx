AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. To learn more, see the [Amplify Studio introduction](/console/).

Amplify Studio is available in the following regions: [Amplify Studio service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/amplify.html#amplifyadmin_region).

You can get started with or without an AWS account. Without an AWS account, you can begin modeling data for your backend and testing it locally. If you choose to create an AWS account and deploy your backend in the AWS Amplify console, an expanded set of features becomes available for configuring your backend environment.

## Get started without an AWS account

If you are new to AWS, you don't need an AWS account to get started. You can still model and test your data before deploying to the cloud. After building your data model, you must connect an AWS account to deploy your backend environment to Amplify using Amplify Studio. The sandbox interface lets you perform the following tasks:
 * Set up your data model. For instructions on creating models and setting relationships, see [Data modeling in Amplify Studio](/console/data/data-model#Data-modeling-in-the-Admin-UI).
 * Test your new data model locally.
 * Deploy your backend to the cloud. This requires an AWS account.

## Get started with your AWS account

If you already have an AWS account and you want to skip the sandbox experience, deploy Amplify Studio to start using all Amplify features, including DataStore, user authentication and authorization, and file storage. After you deploy a backend in Amplify, you can launch Amplify Studio from your Amplify project. Your entire team can use Studio to add new features, update app data, and manage users and groups.

### To get started with a new Amplify project
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify. Choose **Create app backend**.
2. Enter a name for your app and choose **Confirm deployment**. This deploys a default **staging** backend environment.
3. On the application information page, choose the **Backend environments** tab.
4. Choose **Launch Studio**. This automatically logs you in to Amplify Studio.

If you already have an existing backend environment, you can enable Amplify Studio from the console.

### To get started from an existing Amplify project

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify. Or, enter `amplify console` from the Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI).
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Amplify Studio settings**.
3. Turn on **Enable Amplify Studio**.
4. In the **Backend environments** section, choose **Launch Studio**.  This automatically logs you in to Amplify Studio where you can use all the Studio capabilities.
