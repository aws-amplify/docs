AWS Amplify Studio is a visual development environment for building fullstack web and mobile apps. To learn more, see the [Amplify Studio introduction](/console/).

Amplify Studio is available in the following regions: [Amplify Studio service endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/amplify.html#amplifyadmin_region).

<Callout warning>

We recommend operating Amplify workloads in dedicated accounts so IAM principals not working with Amplify do not manipulate provisioned resources out-of-band.
