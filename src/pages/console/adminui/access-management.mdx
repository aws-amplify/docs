With Amplify Studio, team members with different job functions can collaborate on different aspects of a project deployed in Amplify. Studio developers can create accounts with scoped access to resources and invite team members to join via email. Team members with *Full access* can create and manage AWS resources, while team members with *Manage only* access can edit application content and users.

Studio manages user access using an Amazon Cognito User Pool in your account. If you visit Cognito from the AWS console you should see a User Pool named *amplify_backend_manager_APPID*. This User Pool is managed by Studio so please do not modify the settings for this resource. You can invite up to 50,000 monthly users to Studio without cost.

Follow these instructions to add and manage team members and their access to a project.

## To invite team members to access a project

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open AWS Amplify.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Amplify Studio settings**.
3. On the **Amplify Studio settings** page, in the **Access control settings** section, choose **Add team members**.
4. For **Email**, enter the email address of the team member to invite.
5. For **Access level**, choose the level of access to grant the team member.
  * **Full access** allows the team member to create and manage AWS resources.
  * **Manage only** access allows the team member to edit app content and users.
6. To email the invitation, choose **Send invite**. The team member receives an email with temporary credentials and a link to access the project in Studio.

<Callout warning>

  Granting a user the **Full Access** level attaches the **AdministratorAccess-Amplify** IAM policy. This IAM policy is not scoped to a single application and grants the user access to all applications within the AWS account. See [AWS managed policies for AWS Amplify](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/security-iam-awsmanpol.html) for more details.
