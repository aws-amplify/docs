Studio also allows you to bind UI elements to real backend data. Add properties to components, then reference the properties in your child UI elements. To get started, navigate into a UI component by choosing the **Configure** button in the **UI Library**. For this example, you'll use the *CardB* component.

## Add a component property

To add a property, choose **Add prop** and set a name for your property. For this example, create a new property called `home` with the type `Home`.

## Set child property values

Select a child element such as the "$99 USD" Text element and choose **Set prop**. Here, you are able to set all available properties for that child element. Configure the `label` for the text element and set the value to "Price: $" and then select *Command + Enter* on your keyboard to concatenate another value such as `home.price`.

Bind the address text element's `label` to `home.address` and the image's `src` to `home.image_url`.

You are also able to set traditional HTML properties through Studio. For example, hide the text element containing "4bds 3 ba 2,530 sqft - Active" by setting the `display` to `none`.

## Shuffle preview data
To see how your component scales with different data, choose the **Shuffle preview data** button. This selects a random record in your database and applies it as a property to preview the component.
