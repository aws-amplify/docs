Amplify Studio also allows you to build lists and grids based on individual UI components. Let's create a "NewHomes" grid that showcases the latest homes added to the app.

## Create a collection
To get started, choose the **Create collection** button in the top right corner in the UI component editor.

Specify a name for the new collection component, or use the default name provided by Studio. For this example, we'll name the collection `NewHomes`.

## Modify collection styling

On the left side of the component editor, you can modify all the style settings for your collection. In our case, we'll choose a grid and apply column and margin settings to add spacing between the items.

1. Select **Grid** as the *Type*
2. Change *Columns* to **3**
3. Add *Padding* to **10px** on all sides

Your collection should look similar to the following:

## Modify collection data

Next, let's populate the list with all recently created homes. By default, Amplify Studio renders collections with all records from the specified model. For our example, we will apply a sort condition to sort the records by the most recently created homes.

Modify the rendered data set by choosing **View/Edit** on the panel on the right side. Then choose **Add sort** and select **createdAt** and **Descending** as the sort condition.

Once configured, choose **Create data set** to display your collection sorted by the most recently created time stamp.

## Use a collection in your app

Similar to individual components, choose **Get component code** to get your React code for the collection.

Run `amplify pull` to sync all your components, including the `NewHomes` collection, into your local `./ui-components` folder.

Import the `NewHomes` collection from `./ui-components` and then render it in your React app. For example:

```js
import { NewHomes } from './ui-components'
...
  return <div>
    <NewHomes />
  </div>
...
```
