Amplify Studio provides a visual way to create your app's data model and manage the contents of your database.

## Create data model

To get started, from the **Set up** menu, choose **Data**. On the **Data modeling** page, choose **Add model** to create your first data model. Think of a model as a table in your database.

In this case, you'll create a `Home` model and add a few fields like `address (String)`, `price (Float)`, and `image_url (String)`.

You can take this further by adding more data models to your app and creating relationships between them. 

Once you're ready, choose **Save and Deploy** to deploy your data model to the cloud.

## Browse and auto-generate your app data

After your backend is deployed, choose **Content** on the **Manage** menu to start browsing your app data. Amplify Studio also provides a feature to *auto-generate seed data* to help you test your app faster.

Choose **Auto-generate data** from the **Actions** menu.

The auto-generate seed data functionality also allows you to set constraints to make the generated seed data more semantically accurate. In your case, set a constraint for `address` as "Street address".

Five records are now created. To better showcase image support for the rest of this tutorial, select each record and modify the `image_url` to a publicly reachable image URL.
