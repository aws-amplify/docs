The Admin UI **Content** management view provides a tabular view of the backend data for an application. You can use this feature to test your models and to provide both technical and non-technical team members with the ability to create and update an application's data in real-time instead of building admin views.

The [Data modeling](/console/data/data-model) topic guides you through several examples for creating data models and setting the relationships between them. The following content management procedures, reference the *Book* and *Author* tables that were created in the data modeling example in order to demonstrate how to perform operations on your data.

## To create data
1. Open the Admin UI for an app.
2. On the **Manage** menu, choose **Content**.
3. On the **Content** page, select the table to update from the **Select table** menu. For this example, select the *Author* table.
4. Choose **Create author**.
5. In the **Add Author** window, specify your custom values for the fields in the table. For this example, enter *Martha* for the *firstName* field and enter *Riviera* for the *lastName* field.
6. Choose **Save author**.

## To edit data
1. Open the Admin UI for an app.
2. On the **Manage** menu, choose **Content**.
3. On the **Content** page, select the table to update from the **Select table** menu. For this example, select the *Author* table that we used in the previous procedure.
4. From the list of records, select the record to update. For this example, select *Martha Riviera*. Let's assume that the last name of the author is misspelled and needs to be corrected.
5. On the **Actions** menu, choose **Edit**.
6. In the **Edit Author** window, change the spelling of the author's last name. Enter *Rivera* in the *lastName* field, then choose **Save author**.

## To create and link data
When you create a new instance in a table, you can also link it to an instance in another table based on the relationships between the data models. 

1. Open the Admin UI for an app.
2. On the **Manage** menu, choose **Content**.
3. On the **Content** page, select the table to update from the **Select table** menu. For this example, select the *Book* table, to add a new instance of a book. 
4. Choose **Create book**. For *title*, enter *All About Dogs*. 
5. Let's link this book to the *Martha Rivera* author instance that we edited in the previous procedure. Choose **Link to an existing Author**, then choose *Martha Rivera* from the list of *Author* instances. Note that you have the option to link to an an author because a relationship was defined between the *Book* and *Author* tables during the data modeling process.
6. View the details for the *All About Dogs* instance in the *Book* table, and *Martha Rivera* is listed as an author. 

## To delete data
1. Open the Admin UI for an app.
2. On the **Manage** menu, choose **Content**.
3. On the **Content** page, select the table to update from the **Select table** menu. For this example, select the *Author* table that we used in the previous procedure.
4. From the list of records in the table, select the record to delete. For this example, select *Martha Rivera*. On the **Actions** menu, then choose **Delete**.
5. In the **Delete item** confirmation window, choose **Delete**.

## Create or edit data in markdown
You can also edit and store the data as markdown with the markdown editor. This is especially useful for blogs, news, marketing, or content-focused apps where you want the app UI to be styled appropriately. The markdown editor is available by choosing **Edit in markdown** when you are in the **Edit** window for a data instance.
