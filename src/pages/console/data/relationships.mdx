## Model data for a one to one relationship

 In this scenario, the bookstore maintains a list of ISBN numbers to track the books it sells. Each book has only one ISBN number and each ISBN number is assigned to only one book. This is an example of a one to one (1:1) data relationship between ISBN numbers and books. Use the following instructions to model the *Book* and *ISBN* data types and their relationship in Admin UI. 

1. In the cloned schema, define the one to one data relationship between `ISBN` and `Book`, as each book has a single ISBN number and each ISBN number is associated with a single book. On the ISBN type, choose **Add a relationship**. 
1. In the **Add relationship** window, in the **Select related model** menu, choose `Book`. For the relationship type, choose **One ISBN to one Book**. For **Relationship name**, enter `Book`. Choose **Save**. The relationship should look like the following.

When you return to the **Data modeling** page, the `ISBN` model will be updated with the relationship information. Now repeat the same steps for the `Book` model - define a 1:1 relationship from Book to ISBN.

## Model data for a one to many relationship

Now let's create a data model for publishers. Each book in the bookstore has only one publisher. However, each publisher can publish many books. This represents a one to many relationship (1:n) between publishers and books that we can model in our example.

1. In the cloned schema, select the `Publisher` model.
1. For the `Publisher` model, choose **Add a relationship**.
1. In the **Add relationship** window, in the **Select related model** menu, choose `Book`. For the relationship type, choose **One Publisher to many Book**. For **Relationship name**, enter `books`. Choose **Save**. The relationship should look like the following.

## Model data for a many to many relationship

Let's add a final data model for authors to our example. A book can have a single author or multiple authors. Therefore, a book in the bookstore can be written by many authors and each author can write many books. This is a many to many (m:n)data relationship between books and authors that we can model in our example.

1. In the cloned schema, select the `Author` model.
4. For the `Author` model, choose **Add a relationship**.
5. In the **Add relationship** window, choose `Book` from the **Select related model** menu. For the relationship type, choose **Many Author to many Book**. For **Relationship name**, enter a meaningful name, such as `Book`. Choose **Save**. The relationship should look like the following.

## Test data model works as expected

When you are finished modeling your data and defining the data relationships, you can save and deploy the models to an Amplify backend environment.

1. Choose **Deploy** in the upper right corner of the **Data modeling** page.

2. If you are working in the sandbox, on the **Deploy to AWS** page, either choose **Create an AWS account** or **Login to deploy AWS Account** and proceed with the deployment process.

3. If you are working in the Admin UI from your AWS account, the deployment status displays in the upper right corner of the page.

4. Navigate to the **Content** tab and create data in the tables. You should be able to create and link records from different models. For more information, see [Manage content](/console/data/content-management).
