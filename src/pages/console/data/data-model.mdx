## Data modeling example

In this example we will build a data model for a bookstore to maintain information about books, authors, and publishers with relationships and authorization rules. The schema template below is a starting point for the bookstore backend.

<Grid grid-gap="2" columns={1} className="margin-top-lg margin-bottom-lg">
  <Card
    external
    href="https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/schema-design/4f1a9f51-5783-4da5-9db1-60ce071e6539/clone"
    containertag="amplify-external-link"
  >
    <CardGraphic alt="Admin UI logo" src="/images/console/adminui.svg" />
    <CardDetail>
      <h4>Clone in Sandbox</h4>
      <p>
        A bookstore data model template with four models called Book, ISBN,
        Publisher, and Author
      </p>
    </CardDetail>
  </Card>
</Grid>

Skip ahead to [relationships](/console/data/relationships) or read below on how data modeling works in the Admin UI.

## Data modeling in the Admin UI

The Admin UI data model designer provides a visual way to define your app's data model, relationships, and authorization rules. Admin UI generates a `schema.graphql` GraphQL Transform for the data model you create. To learn more about how the GraphQl transform works, see [GraphQL Transform Overview](/cli/graphql-transformer/overview).

All data models built with Admin UI work with Amplify DataStore out-of-the-box. [DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started) is an on-device storage engine that automatically synchronizes data between your mobile and web apps and your database in the AWS cloud to help you build real-time and offline apps faster.

The experience for modeling data is the same in the sandbox and in the Admin UI. With an AWS account, you will have real-time data synchronization capabilities and you will also be able to set authorization rules on your models. For more information, see [Authorization](/console/authz/authorization). All data models are provisioned in your account as AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs and Amazon DynamoDB tables. As with every feature of the Admin UI, it can be further extended with the CLI.
