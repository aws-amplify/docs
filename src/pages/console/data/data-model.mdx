## Data modeling example

In this example you will build a data model for a bookstore to maintain information about books, authors, and publishers with relationships and authorization rules. The schema template below is a starting point for the bookstore backend.

<Grid grid-gap="2" columns={1} className="margin-top-lg margin-bottom-lg">
  <Card
    external
    href="https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/schema-design/4f1a9f51-5783-4da5-9db1-60ce071e6539/clone"
    containertag="amplify-external-link"
  >
    <CardGraphic alt="Amplify Studio logo" src="/images/console/adminui.svg" />
    <CardDetail>
      <h4>Clone in Sandbox</h4>
      <p>
        A bookstore data model template with four models called Book, ISBN,
        Publisher, and Author
      </p>
    </CardDetail>
  </Card>
</Grid>

Skip ahead to [relationships](/console/data/relationships) or read below on how data modeling works in Amplify Studio.

## Data modeling in Amplify Studio

The Studio data model designer provides a visual way to define your app's data model, relationships, and authorization rules. Studio generates a `schema.graphql` GraphQL Transform for the data model you create. To learn more about how the GraphQl transform works, see [GraphQL Transform Overview](/cli/graphql-transformer/overview).

The experience for modeling data is the same in the sandbox and in Studio. With an AWS account, you will have real-time data synchronization capabilities and you will also be able to set authorization rules on your models. For more information, see [Authorization](/console/authz/authorization). All data models are provisioned in your account as AWS AppSync GraphQL APIs and Amazon DynamoDB tables. As with every feature of Studio, your data model can be further extended with the CLI.

### Conflict Resolution and GraphQL APIs
By default, all GraphQL APIs built with Studio are provisioned with Conflict Resolution **enabled**. 

Conflict Resolution is used by **[DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started)**, an on-device storage engine that enables offline use. DataStore requires a Conflict Resolution strategy to resolve data conflicts that arise from using an app offline. 

Learn more about Conflict Resolution strategies in the [AppSync documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/conflict-detection-and-sync.html#conflict-detection-and-resolution).

### Change Conflict Resolution settings
To change your app's Conflict Resolution strategy, or to enable or disable Conflict Resolution entirely, take the following steps:
1. Navigate to **Amplify Studio > Data**
2. Select **GraphQL API settings** at the top of the page
3. Toggle DataStore off or on, or change your Conflict Resolution strategy
4. Return to the Data Modeling screen and select **Save and Deploy**

<Callout warning>

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: Activating and deactivating Conflict Resolution is a **destructive** change to your data structure, and isn't recommended if you have existing data. 

</Callout>

### Limitations
GraphQL APIs with Conflict Resolution disabled have limited feature availability in Studio. 
- The Content Manager is not supported, and is [replaced by a GraphiQL interface](content-management/#limitations)
- [Binding UI Components to data](../uibuilder/databinding/), and [generating Collections](../uibuilder/collections/) is not supported
- [Binding Forms to data, and auto-generated forms](../formbuilder/overview/) are not supported

To get access to these features, activate Conflict Resolution and **Save and Deploy** your schema.
