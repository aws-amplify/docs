For offline scenarios, Amplify provides [DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started).

[Amplify DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started) uses AWS AppSync to make it easy to build apps that need to support offline and low-latency scenarios. DataStore also makes working with distributed, cross-user data just as simple as working with local-only data by providing a programming model for leveraging shared and distributed data without writing additional code.

To learn more about building offline-first apps with DataStore, check out the documentation [here](/lib/datastore/getting-started).
