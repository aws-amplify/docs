You can read application data using the Amplify GraphQL client. In this guide we will review the difference between reading data and getting data, how to filter query results to get just the data you need, and how to paginate results to make you're data more manageable. We will also show you how to cancel these requests when needed.

Before you begin, you will need:
- An application connected to the API
- Data already created to view

## Read and filter your data
  
Queries are used to read data via the API and include the `List` and `Get` operations.
  
You can use both `List` and `Get` to query data in GraphQL. A `List` will get you a record of several items, such as Todo items, and does not require an ID. This is best suited for getting an overview or summary of items or can help when filtering by specific criteria across a list of items. When you want to query a single entry by ID, you would use `Get` to retrieve a specific Todo item.

<Callout>

__Note:__ The cost structure of your underlying data source can impact the cost to run some queries. For example, the `List` operation uses "scan operations" which uses more read request units than the `Get` operation. You will want to review the associated costs for these operations for your data source. In our example case here we are using Amazon DynamoDB and you can [learn more about how DynamoDB pricing is calculated](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/) on their site.

[TODO]: # (Follow up on the following codegen section for better placement. May be shifted to a different section.)

The Amplify CLI's codegen automatically creates code for all possible GraphQL operationsâ€”mutations, queries, and subscriptions. For JavaScript applications, this generated code is saved in the src/graphql folder. 

```javascript
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import * as subscriptions from './graphql/subscriptions';
```

To run a GraphQL query, import the generated query and run it with `API.graphql`:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { ListTodosQuery, GetTodoQuery } from './API';

// Simple query
const allTodos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>(
  { query: queries.listTodos }
);
console.log(allTodos); // result: { "data": { "listTodos": { "items": [/* ..... */] } } }

// Fetch a single record by its identifier
const oneTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<GetTodoQuery>>({
  query: queries.getTodo,
  variables: { id: 'some id' }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';

// Simple query
const allTodos = await API.graphql({ query: queries.listTodos });
console.log(allTodos); // result: { "data": { "listTodos": { "items": [/* ..... */] } } }

//Fetch a single record by its identifier
const oneTodo = await API.graphql({
  query: queries.getTodo,

<Accordion title='Troubleshooting deny-by-default behavior' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Troubleshooting'>

You can run into unauthorized errors if you do not have at least one auth rule defined. 

Use the `@auth` directive to configure authorization rules for public, sign-in user, per user, and per user group data access. **Authorization rules operate on the deny-by-default principle**. Meaning that if an authorization rule is not specifically configured, it is denied.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, each signed-in user, or also known as "owner", of a Todo can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

Amplify also allows you to restrict the allowed operations, combine multiple authorization rules, and apply fine-grained field-level authorization.

``` graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [
  { allow: public, operations: [read]},
  { allow: owner }
]) {
  content: String
}
```

In the example above, everyone (`public`) can read every Todo but owner (authenticated users) can create, read, update, and delete their own Todos.

To learn more, see the [Authorization Rules for the API](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/authorization-rules/).

</Accordion>

<br/>

<Accordion title='Custom authorization mode to query data' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Each AWS AppSync API uses a default authorization mode when you configure your app. To override this default, pass an `authMode` property. For example, this is useful when you have public reads through API Key auth and authenticated reads through IAM auth. The following examples show how you can query data with custom authorization mode:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLQuery, GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import { GetTodoQuery } from './API';

const todos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<GetTodoQuery>>({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';


const todos = await API.graphql({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

</Accordion>

## Paginate your data
  
As your data grows, you will want to filter and paginate at the AWS AppSync level instead of on the client. Fortunately, this is already built in to `API.graphql`, but you need to understand the schema of these queries. This is explained in the [AWS AppSync docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/using-your-api.html), but here you will translate them to the `API.graphql` equivalent.

You can find the input schemas in the Docs pane of the GraphQL explorer or inside your autogenerated `/graphql` folder. They look like this:

```graphql
listTodos(
  filter: ModelTodoFilterInput
  limit: Int
  nextToken: String): ModelTodoConnection

input ModelTodoFilterInput {
	id: ModelIDInput
	priority: ModelIntInput
	# ... all your other Todo fields here
	and: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	or: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	not: ModelTodoFilterInput
}
```

### Filtering queries

The input types in your schema indicate what kinds of filtering you can perform on them. For example, an integer field like `ModelIntInput` has this schema:

```graphql
input ModelIntInput {
  ne: Int # "not equal to"
  eq: Int # "equal to"
  le: Int # "less than or equal to"
  lt: Int # "less than"
  ge: Int # "greater than or equal to"
  gt: Int # "greater than"
  between: [Int]
  attributeExists: Boolean
  attributeType: ModelAttributeTypes
}
```

These vary based on the type of the field, but are linked to corresponding [Amazon DynamoDB queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Condition.html).

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
const variables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});;
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

#### Compound filters

You can combine filters with `and`, `or`, and `not` Boolean logic. Observe, in the autogenerated schema above, that `ModelTodoFilterInput` is recursive in respect to those fields. So if, for example, you wanted to filter for `priority` values of 1 OR 2, you would do this:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    or: [
      { priority: { eq:1 } },
      { priority: { eq:2 } }
    ]
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
const variables = {
  filter: {
    or: [
      { priority: { eq:1 } },
      { priority: { eq:2 } }
    ]
  }
};

await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});;
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Note that querying for `priority` of 1 and 2 would return no results, because this is Boolean logic instead of natural language.

### Paginating queries

To paginate results in AWS AppSync, make a query request specifying the `nextToken` field in the selection set and by passing in a `limit` input variable. The `limit` input variable limits how many results are returned. The response will include a `nextToken` you can use to request the next page of data. A `nextToken` is a very long string that represents the cursor to the starting item of the next query made with these filters.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

// Fetch first 20 records
const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  limit: 20, 
  // add filter as needed
};

const res = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data?.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data?.listTodos;
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
// Fetch first 20 records
const variables = {
  limit: 20, 
  // add filter as needed
};

const res = await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res = await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data.listTodos;
```

<Accordion title='Implement pagination in your GraphQL API' headingLevel='3' eyebrow='Walkthrough'>

This brief walkthrough provides additional step-by-step guidance for implementing pagination. 

When working with a large record set, you may want to only fetch the first __N__ number of items. For example, let's start with a basic GraphQL schema for a Todo app:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String 
}
```

When the API is created with an `@model` directive, the following queries will automatically be created for you:

```graphql
type Query {
  getTodo(id: ID!): Todo
  listTodos(filter: ModelTodoFilterInput, limit: Int, nextToken: String): ModelTodoConnection
}
```

Next, take a look at the `ModelTodoConnection` type to get an idea of the data that will be returned when the `listTodos` query is run:

```graphql
type ModelTodoConnection {
  items: [Todo]
  nextToken: String
}
```

When querying the API using the `listTodos` query, the return type will be of `ModelTodoConnection`, meaning you can return both an array of `Todos` and a `nextToken`.

The `nextToken` is what is used to handle pagination. If the `nextToken` is `null`, that means that there is no more data to return from the API. If the `nextToken` is present, you can use the value as an argument to the next `listTodos` query to return the next selection set from the API.

To test this out, try creating 5 Todos using a mutation like this:

```sh
mutation createTodo {
  createTodo(input: {
    title: "Todo 1"
    description: "My first todo"
  }) {
    id
    title
    description
  }
}
```

Next, you can set the limit of the number of Todos in a query by passing in a `limit` argument. In this query, you'll set the limit to 2 items and request a `nextToken` as a return value:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

 Now, to query the next 2 items from the API, you can pass this `nextToken` as the argument:

```graphql
query listTodos {
  listTodos(limit: 2, nextToken: <your_token>) {
    items {
      id
      title
      description
    }
    nextToken
  }
}
```

When there are no other items left to be returned, the `nextToken` in the response will be set to null.

#### Querying from a JavaScript application

The `listTodos` query should have been created for you automatically by the CLI, but for reference purposes it should look something like this:

```js
const listTodos = `
  query listTodos($limit: Int) {
    listTodos(limit: $limit) {
      items {
        id
        title
        description
      }
      nextToken
    }
  }
`
```

To pass in a `limit` in a query from a JavaScript application, you can use the following code by setting the limit as a variable:

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

async function fetchTodos() {
  const todoData = await API.graphql({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: {
      limit: 2
    }
  })
  console.log({ todoData })
}
```

The data returned from the API request should look like this (with the items array containing however many items have been created):

```graphql
{
  "data" {
    "listTodos" {
      "items": [{ id: "001", title: "Todo 1", description: "My first todo" }],
      "nextToken": "<token-id>"
    }
  }
}
```

To set the `nextToken` in a query from a JavaScript application, you can use the following code:

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';

async function fetchTodos() {
  const todoData = await API.graphql({
    query: listTodos,
    variables: {
      limit: 2,
      nextToken: "<token-id>"
    }
  })
  console.log({ todoData })
}
```

</Accordion>

<br/>

<Callout>

__Limitations:__
- There is no API to get a total page count at this time. Note that scanning all items is a [potentially expensive operation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2901).
- Sorting is [available in DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/data-access/q/platform/js#predicates) but not in AWS AppSync.
- AWS AppSync schemas do not follow the edges/nodes of the [Relay spec](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification) but are spiritually similar.
- You [cannot query by `page` number](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/5086), you have to query by `nextToken`.

</Callout>

## Cancel read requests

You may cancel any query or mutation request made through the API category by keeping a reference to the promise returned.

```javascript
const promise = API.graphql({ query: "..." });

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (API.isCancel(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
API.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `API.graphql()` has not been modified. Typically, async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will not work:

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return API.graphql({ query: "..." });
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
API.cancel(promise, "my error message");
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the **Read application data** guide. In this guide, you learned how to read your data through `Get` and `List` queries.

## Next steps

Our recommended next steps include subscribing to real-time events to look for mutations in your data and continuing to build out and customize your information architecture for your data. Some resources that will help with this work include:
