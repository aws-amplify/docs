};

In order to configure fine grain authorization controls with DataStore, use the `@auth` directive to specify ownership and permissible operations (create, update, delete, read) on a specific type. More information can be found on the @auth directive in the [GraphQL Transformer documentation](/cli/graphql-transformer/auth).
