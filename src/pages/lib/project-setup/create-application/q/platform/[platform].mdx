To set up the project, you will need to create a new Next.js app with the
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) tool.
You'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

Run the following command and following the instructions to create a Next.js app.

```shellscript
npx create-next-app@latest next-amplified
```

Then run the following command to enter the root of your Next.js app.

```shellscript
cd next-amplified
```

You can now run the app in development mode by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

<Block name="Angular">

Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new amplify-app

? Would you like to add Angular routing? Y
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (your preferred stylesheet provider)

cd amplify-app
```

<Block name="Angular 15">

First, create `src/polyfills.ts` and add the following:

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

Then, open your `angular.json` file, and add `src/polyfills.ts` to polyfills array(s) in your `angular.json`. These arrays are located in projects.`<project-name>.architect.<task-name>.options`.

```javascript
"polyfills": [
  "zone.js",
  "src/polyfills.ts"
],
```

And finally, make sure to add `src/polyfills` to files in your `tsconfig.app.json`:

```javascript
{
  "files": [
    "src/main.ts",
    "src/polyfills.ts"
  ],
}
```
</Block>

<Block name="Angular 10-14">

Add the following to your `src/polyfills.ts` file to recreate them: 

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

<Block name="ReactJS">

To get started, first create a new React app using Vite, and then install and use the Amplify CLI to start adding backend capabilities to your app.

From your projects directory, run the following commands and follow the prompts:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
This creates a new React app in a new directory. Navigate to your new directory and run the app by using the following command:

```bash
cd <your project directory>
```

Then, install your dependencies and run the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and see preview your app locally.

</Block>

<Block name="VueJS">

Use the Vue Vite powered `create-app` to bootstrap a new Vue 3 app (select required configuration, selecting the defaults as an example for this project):

```bash
npm init vue@3

Need to install the following packages:
  create-vue@3
Ok to proceed? (y) y

✔ Project name: … myamplifyproject
✔ Add TypeScript? … No 
✔ Add JSX Support? … No 
✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? … No 
✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No 
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? … No 
✔ Add Cypress for both Unit and End-to-End testing? … No 
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … No 
```

This creates a new Vue app in a new directory. Navigate to your new directory and run the app by using the following command:

```bash
cd <your project directory>
```

Then, install your dependencies and run the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This runs a development server and see preview your app locally.

## Create a New Amplify Backend

Now that you have a running app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you
can set up the backend services you need.

<Callout warning>

Please ensure the Amplify CLI version in
your system is higher than `12.5.1`. You can check the CLI version by
running `amplify --version`.

</Callout>

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app.

```console
? Enter a name for the project (nextamplified)
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: nextamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: <detected framework>
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend
definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API
and authentication. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with
infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack.
Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` in the `src` directory that holds
all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the
Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be
accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend
environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status
of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete
backend resources.

As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration
using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in `amplifyconfiguration.json` will update
automatically.

## Install Amplify libraries

Install required dependencies to your Next.js app to start using Amplify.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@next
```

You are now ready to start adding features to your application. Below are some examples of features you can start adding to your app.

- [Authentication](/lib-v1/auth/getting-started)
- [File Storage](/lib-v1/storage/getting-started)
- [Analytics](/lib-v1/analytics/getting-started)
