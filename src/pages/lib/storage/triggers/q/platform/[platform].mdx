If you are looking to enable triggers for the Storage Category with Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB as Providers, the CLI supports associating Lambda triggers with S3 and DynamoDB events. For example, this can be useful for a use case where you want to invoke a Lambda function after a create or update operation on a DynamoDB table managed by the Amplify CLI.

For more information on this topic, please read on [File Storage Lambda Triggers](/cli/usage/lambda-triggers#s3-lambda-triggers) through our Amplify CLI documentation.
