## Subscribing to Events

You can take specific actions when users sign-in or sign-out by subscribing authentication events in your app. Please see our [Hub Module Developer Guide](/lib-v1/utilities/hub) for more information.

## Lambda Triggers

The CLI allows you to configure [Lambda Triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools-working-with-aws-lambda-triggers.html) for your Cognito user pool. These enable you to add custom functionality to your registration and authentication flows. [Read more](/cli/function/function)

### Pre Authentication and Pre Sign-up Lambda triggers

If you have a Pre Authentication Lambda trigger enabled, you can pass `clientMetadata` as an option for `signIn`. This metadata can be used to implement additional validations around authentication.

```ts
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

async function handleSignIn(username, password) {
  try {
    await signIn({
      username,
      password,
      options: {
        serviceOptions: {
          clientMetadata: {} // Optional, an object of key-value pairs which can contain any key and will be passed to your Lambda trigger as-is.
        }
      }
    });
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

### Passing metadata to other Lambda triggers

Many Cognito Lambda Triggers also accept unsanitized key/value pairs in the form of a `clientMetadata` attribute.  This attribute can be specified for various Auth APIs which result in Cognito Lambda Trigger execution.

These APIs include:

- `signIn`
- `signUp`
- `confirmSignIn`
- `confirmSignUp`
- `resetPassword`
- `confirmResetPassword`
- `resendSignUpCode`
- `updateUserAttributes`

Please note that some of triggers which accept a `validationData` attribute will use `clientMetadata` as the value for `validationData`.  Exercise caution with using `clientMetadata` when you are relying on `validationData`.

## Working with AWS service objects

You can use AWS *Service Interface Objects* to work AWS Services in authenticated State. You can call methods on any AWS Service interface object by passing your credentials from Amplify to the service call constructor:

```javascript
import { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
import Route53 from 'aws-sdk/clients/route53';

async function changeResourceRecordSets() {
  try {
    const { credentials } = await fetchAuthSession();
  
    const route53 = new Route53({
      apiVersion: '2013-04-01',
      credentials
    });
  
    // more code working with route53 object
    //route53.changeResourceRecordSets();
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
};
```

<Callout warning>

Note: To work with Service Interface Objects, your Amazon Cognito users' [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/iam-roles.html) must have the appropriate permissions to call the requested services.
