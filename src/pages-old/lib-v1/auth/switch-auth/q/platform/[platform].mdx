For client side authentication there are three different flows:

1. `USER_SRP_AUTH`: The `USER_SRP_AUTH` flow uses the [SRP protocol (Secure Remote Password)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol) where the password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server. This is the recommended flow and is used by default.

2. `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`: The `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow will send user credentials to the backend without applying SRP encryption. If you want to migrate users to Cognito using the "Migration" trigger and avoid forcing users to reset their passwords, you will need to use this authentication type because the Lambda function invoked by the trigger needs to verify the supplied credentials.

3. `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` & `CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP`: Allows for a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements.

The Auth flow can be customized when calling `signIn`, for example:

```javascript
signIn({
  username,
  password,
  options: {
    serviceOptions: {
      authFlowType: 'USER_PASSWORD_AUTH'
    }
  }
})
```

## USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow

A use case for the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow is migrating users into Amazon Cognito

### Set up auth backend

In order to use the authentication flow `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, your Cognito app client has to be configured to allow it. In the AWS Console, this is done by ticking the checkbox at General settings > App clients > Show Details (for the affected client) > Enable username-password (non-SRP) flow. If you're using the AWS CLI or CloudFormation, update your app client by adding `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` to the list of "Explicit Auth Flows".

### Migrate users with Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides a trigger to migrate users from your existing user directory seamlessly into Cognito. You achieve this by configuring your user pool's "Migration" trigger which invokes a Lambda function whenever a user that does not already exist in the user pool authenticates, or resets their password.

In short, the Lambda function will validate the user credentials against your existing user directory and return a response object containing the user attributes and status on success. An error message will be returned if an error occurs. There's a documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html) on how to set up this migration flow and more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-migrate-user.html#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-user-migration) on how the lambda should handle request and response objects.

## `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` & `CUSTOM_WITHOUT_SRP` flows

Amazon Cognito user pools supports customizing the authentication flow to enable custom challenge types, in addition to a password in order to verify the identity of users. These challenge types may include CAPTCHAs or dynamic challenge questions. The `CUSTOM_WITH_SRP` flow requires a password when calling `signIn`. Both of these flows map to the `CUSTOM_AUTH` flow in Cognito.

To define your challenges for custom authentication flow, you need to implement three Lambda triggers for Amazon Cognito. Please see the [Lambda Triggers](/lib-v1/auth/advanced/q/platform/js/#lambda-triggers) section for more information.
