Amplify CLI can be used to easily re-create resources in a different AWS account.

Run the following steps to migrate an existing project to another AWS account.

1. Clone your repository
2. Run `amplify init`
3. Select an AWS Profile that will connect to the new account (Do not use an existing environment)

Amplify CLI updates the `amplify/team-provider-info.json` file with the new environment name. Run `amplify env list` to see an additional environment that is connected to the account of the new profile.

<Callout warning>

If your project includes custom resources, cloning the project to a new environment may not work correctly.
Ensure that custom resource names are parameterized to guarantee uniqueness when cloning between accounts, regions and Amplify environments
