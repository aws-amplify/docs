👏  In this tutorial you created fully featured CRUD application using Amplify API and Authentication. 
But your Amplify journey is just getting started! You can now explore the API and Authentication categories 
in more depth or dive into the other categories and add them to your application.

- [Authentication](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/set-up-auth/)
- [Analytics](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/analytics/set-up-analytics/)
- [GraphQL API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api/)
- [REST API](/[platform]/build-a-backend/restapi/set-up-rest-api/)
- [Storage](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/set-up-storage/)

### Escape Hatch

As an alternative to the Amplify client libraries, or in situations where the libraries do not provide the functionality you require,
the underlying AWS services can be communicated with [directly](/[platform]/start/project-setup/escape-hatch/)
using an HTTP client and the AWS Signature V4 (SigV4) protocol.
