## Set up your application

### Create a new Flutter application

Create a new project using Flutter CLI:

```bash
flutter create amplified_todo --platforms=android,ios
```

### Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for Flutter is distributed via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/amplify_flutter).

1. From your project root directory, find and modify pubspec.yaml and add the Amplify plugins to the project dependencies.

    ```yaml
    environment:
      sdk: ">=2.15.0 <3.0.0"

    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter

      amplify_flutter: ^0.6.0
      amplify_datastore: ^0.6.0
    ```

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command. Depending on your development environment, you may perform this step via your IDE (or it may even be performed for you automatically).

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

### Update target iOS platform

From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and modify the `Podfile` using a text editor of your choice and update the target iOS platform to 13.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

When preparing your application for deployment, you should also update your iOS Deployment Target to at least 13.0. See the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios) to learn more about building your iOS app for release.

### Update target Android SDK version

From your project root, navigate to the `android/app/` directory and modify `build.gradle` using a text editor of your choice and update the target Android SDK version to 21 or higher:

```bash
minSdkVersion 21
```

import flutter1 from '/src/fragments/start/getting-started/flutter/kotlin-version-warning.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: flutter1 }} />

You are ready to start building with Amplify! 🎉
