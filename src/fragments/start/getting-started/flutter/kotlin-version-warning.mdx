<Callout warning>

If you are using Flutter 2.10 or above, you will need to ensure that your app supports an [up-to-date Kotlin version](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/kotlin-version).
This will typically be version 1.5.31 or higher.
<br />
You can do this by updating the Kotlin version in your app's `android/build.gradle` file:

```yaml
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.31'
    ...
}
```
