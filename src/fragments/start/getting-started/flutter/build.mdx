## What you'll build

The stable release of Amplify Flutter currently supports iOS/Android as target platforms.

<Callout warning>

Web and desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth, API, Analytics and Storage categories are now in developer preview!

However, this getting started guide uses the stable release.

See the documentation for [project setup](/lib/project-setup/create-application) and the [Auth category](/lib/auth/getting-started), the API category ([GraphQL](/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started) and [REST](/lib/restapi/getting-started)), the [Analytics category](/lib/analytics/getting-started), and the [Storage category](/lib/storage/getting-started) for more information about web and desktop support.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your web app. You will create a fully featured Todo app using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

This tutorial also assumes you have at least a working knowledge of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) basics.

What you will do:



* Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
* Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
