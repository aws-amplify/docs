## What you'll build

Amplify Flutter supports all Flutter platforms as targets (iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux).

<Callout warning>

The DataStore and Notifications categories only support iOS/Android currently. Please open an issue in our
[GitHub](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/) with your use case if you'd like to see support for 
additional platforms.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your Flutter app. 
You will create a fully featured budget management app using the API and Storage categories to store and 
retrieve items in your cloud backend.

This tutorial assumes you have a working knowledge of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) basics.

What you will do:

* Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data with Amplify API
* Attach images to budget entries using Amplify Storage
