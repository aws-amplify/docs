## What you'll build

The stable release of Amplify Flutter currently supports iOS/Android as target platforms.

<Callout warning>

Web and desktop support for the Amplify Flutter Auth category is now in developer preview! 

However, this getting started guide uses the stable release.

See the documentation for [project setup](/lib/project-setup/create-application) and the [Auth category](/lib/auth/getting-started) for more information about web and desktop support.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your web app. You will create a fully featured Todo app using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

This tutorial also assumes you have at least a working knowledge of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) basics.

What you will do:



* Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
* Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
