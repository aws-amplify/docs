## What we'll build

<Callout warning>

Amplify Flutter currently supports iOS/Android as target platforms. Flutter [Web](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/234) and [Desktop](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/133) support are feature requests that are being tracked in our Github repo.

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your web app. You will create a fully featured Todo app using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

This tutorial also assumes you have at least a working knowledge of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) basics.

What you will do:



* Set up a Flutter application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
* Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
