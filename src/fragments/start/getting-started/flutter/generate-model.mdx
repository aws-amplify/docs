With the basic setup complete, you can now model the data your application will work with. These models are specified as GraphQL schemas. You can [learn more](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/) about GraphQL schemas and data modeling. We can start by creating the budget management data model.

## Create data model

> Make sure you have followed the steps in the [Prerequisites](/[platform]/start/getting-started/installation/) section and have the Amplify CLI installed and configured.

1. In the console, navigate to your project's root.
2. Run `amplify init` to initialize your Amplify project.
3. Enter a name for your project and proceed through the remaining steps. Most of the defaults should be correct for you.

```console
$ amplify init
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project <project-name>
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: <project-name>
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: flutter
| Configuration file location: ./lib/

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

After a minute or so, your project will be initialized and you should see the following message printed to the console:

```console
Deployment state saved successfully.
✔ Initialized provider successfully.
✅ Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything
```

4. Now, we can run `amplify add api` to create the data model.

   - For the first prompt, select **GraphQL**
   - Highlight **Authorization modes** and press `<Enter>`. Change it to **Amazon Cognito User Pool**.
   - Select **Default configuration**, **Username**, then **No, I am done.**
   - Enter `N` when prompted to **Configure additional auth types**
   - Select **Continue**
   - For your schema template, choose **Blank Schema**
   - When prompted to edit the schema, enter `Y`

   Your `schema.graphql` file will open. Replace its contents with the following:

```graphql
type BudgetEntry @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String
  amount: Float!
}
```

5. Save the file.
6. Back in the console, run `amplify push -y`.

   Your project will start deploying to AWS. This is a good time to relax and grab a cup of coffee. After a few minutes, you should see the following:

```console
Deployment state saved successfully.

GraphQL endpoint: <GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT>

GraphQL transformer version: 2
```

7. Finally, run `amplify codegen models` to generate Dart files which enable interacting with the GraphQL schema in a type-safe manner.

Congratulations! You have deployed your first Amplify backend 🎉 You're ready to integrate with the app!
