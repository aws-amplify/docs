With the basic setup complete, you can now model the data your application will work with. Amplify DataStore persists the modeled data on your local device and can even synchronize to a backend API without writing any additional code. These models are specified as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) schemas. You can [learn more](/cli/graphql-transformer/overview) about GraphQL schemas and data modeling. For now, let’s start by generating some initial data models.

<Callout>

**Did you know?** You can get started with Amplify’s [Admin UI](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/) without even creating an AWS Account.

## Create data model

1. Navigate to the [Data feature in AWS Amplify Admin UI](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/start#datastore) and, with **To-do list schema** selected, click **Create new schema**.

2. On the Data modeling screen, you should see your Todo data model.  This is a good start but let’s take it a step further by adding a completion flag to our Todo items.

### Add the isComplete Boolean field

1. Start by clicking **Add a field** under the **Todo** model.
2. Set the **Field name** of this field to **isComplete**
3. For the **Type** of this field, select **Boolean**
4. In the inspector panel, select **Is required** to make this field required

## Generate the models locally

1. If you haven’t already done so, click **Next: Test locally in your app** on the Data modeling screen to proceed
2. On the Test locally in your app screen, you will be prompted with on-screen instructions
    1. **What type of app are you building?**
        1. Platform: **Cross-platform**
        2. Framework / Language: **Flutter**
        3. Click **Next**
    2. **(Optional) Create a new app**
        1. You should have already created a new Flutter app in a previous step, so go ahead and click **Next**
    3. **Install Amplify CLI to pull the data model**
        1. You should have already installed the Amplify CLI in a previous step
        2. Copy and run the command shown in your project root. This command will initialize your current project with Amplify as well as generate the data models you will be using locally
            
            ```bash
            amplify pull --sandboxId <UUID>
            ```
            
    4. Make a note of the sandbox id, just in case!
    5. As the rest of the steps will be covered by the tutorial, you can skip the remaining steps and click **Deploy** on the top right
3. In order to deploy a backend, you will need an AWS account. We will go over this in a later step when we’re ready to sync our app to the cloud. For now, keep the link to this page handy!

At this point, Amplify should have generated several directories and configuration files in your project for you. Let’s take a look at the generated GraphQL schema.

From your project root, navigate to the `amplify/backend/api/amplifyDatasource/` directory and open `schema.graphql` using a text editor of your choice. You should see the following.

```graphql
type Todo @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    description: String
    isComplete: Boolean!
}
```

- This schema also describes a model called Todo with four properties:
    - **id** - an auto-generated identifier field for a Todo item
    - **name** - a non-optional string field containing the name of a Todo item
    - **description** - an optional string field containing additional details about a Todo item
    - **isComplete** - a non-optional boolean field indicating the completion status of a Todo item

        <Callout>

        **Note:** We are also specifying an @auth directive on our model which can be useful for setting up authorization rules later, but for the purposes of this tutorial, the model will be authorized for public access. You can read more about authorization rules [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/setup-auth-rules/q/platform/flutter).

Now that local Amplify and data models are set up, we’re ready to integrate with the app!
