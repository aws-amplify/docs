To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli  

npx create-expo-app amplified_todo

cd my-app
```

Finally, open __App.js__ and add the following lines of code at the top of the file below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify'
import awsconfig from './src/aws-exports'

Amplify.configure(awsconfig)
```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

```bash
npx react-native@latest init amplified_todo
```

Finally, open __index.js__ and add the following lines of code at the top of the file below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './src/aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Install Amplify libraries

Next, install the local Amplify dependencies. The directions here will depend on whether you are using Expo or the React Native CLI.

import all0 from "/src/fragments/start/getting-started/reactnative/getting-started-steps-ui.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />

Now your project is set up and you can begin adding new features.

## Initialize a new backend

With the app running, it's time to set up Amplify and create the backend resources to support the app.

Open a new terminal. From the **amplified_todo** directory, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app, with the option to accept recommended values:

```console
? Enter a name for the project amplifiedtodo
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name:  amplifiedtodo
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react-native
| Source Directory Path: /
| Distribution Directory Path: /
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

...

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

> Amplify CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in where possible. Adjust if needed.

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called **amplify** that stores your backend definition. As you add features, the **amplify** folder will grow with CloudFormation templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code via CloudFormation is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called **aws-exports.js** in the **src** directory that holds all the configuration for the resources you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the **.gitignore** file, adding some generated files to the ignore list.
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources.

## Run your app

To run your React Native app, you can follow the below steps

import reactnative1 from '/src/fragments/lib/project-setup/react-native/run-react-native.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ "react-native": reactnative1 }} />
