## Create a new project

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

With `expo-cli` you can develop for **Android**, **iOS**, and **web** within minutes.

With `react-native-cli` you can develop for **Android** and **iOS**, and you will need about an hour to [Setup development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

Create the new app with the following command:    

```bash

npx create-expo-app amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo

npx expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/webpack-config

```

In the root folder of your project in the **package.json** file, remove the line `"main": "node_modules/expo/AppEntry.js",`

In the root folder of your project create **index.js** file with the following content.

```javascript
// index.js
import { registerRootComponent } from 'expo';

import App from './App';

registerRootComponent(App);

````

Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
````

```console
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

› Press a │ open Android
› Press w │ open web

› Press j │ open debugger
› Press r │ reload app
› Press m │ toggle menu

› Press ? │ show all commands

Logs for your project will appear below. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

After you [Setup development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), create the new app with the following command:    

```bash
npx react-native init amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo

```
Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```console
r - reload the app
d - open developer menu
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Initialize a new backend

With the app running, it's time to set up Amplify and create the backend services to support the app.

Open a new terminal. From the **amplified_todo** directory, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the project.

> Amplify CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in where possible. Here it detected Create React App and provided the proper configuration for type of app, framework, source, distribution, build, and start options.

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called **amplify** that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the **amplify** folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called **aws-exports.js** in the **src** directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the **.gitignore** file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Install Amplify Libraries

The `aws-amplify` package is the main library for working with Amplify Libraries in your projects:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

## Set up frontend

Next, configure Amplify so it can interact with backend services.

Open **index.js** and add the following code below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsExports from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in **aws-exports.js** will update automatically.

Now that your React app is set up and Amplify is initialized, you can add an API in the next step.
