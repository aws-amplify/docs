To start off, you'll need a React Native project. If you have an existing project, you can skip to [Generate model files](/start/getting-started/generate-model).

##  Create a new React Native app

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo">

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli  
expo init amplified_todo

? Choose a template: blank
```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

```bash
npx react-native init amplified_todo
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Install Amplify libraries

Next, install the local Amplify dependencies. The directions here will depend on whether you are using Expo or the React Native CLI.

import all0 from "/src/fragments/start/getting-started/reactnative/getting-started-steps-ui.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />

## Initialize a new Amplify project

An overview of project initialization is documented [here](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/workflows/#initialize-new-project).

From the root of the project, run:

```
amplify init
```

In addition to analyzing the project and confirming the frontend settings, this command will create a cloud project in the [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify) to view and manage resources for the backend environment.

Finally, open __App.js__(Expo) or __index.js__(React Native CLI) and add the following lines of code at the top of the file below the last import:

```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import awsconfig from './src/aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(awsconfig)
```

Now your project is set up and you can begin adding new features.
