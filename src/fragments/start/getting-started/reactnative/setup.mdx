## Create a new project

To get started, initialize a new React Native project.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo CLI">

Create a new app with the following command:    

```bash
npx create-expo-app amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install aws-amplify amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```console
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

› Press a │ open Android
› Press w │ open web

› Press j │ open debugger
› Press r │ reload app
› Press m │ toggle menu

› Press ? │ show all commands

Logs for your project will appear below. Press Ctrl+C to exit.
```

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

After you [setup development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), create a new app with the following command:    

```bash
npx react-native init amplified_todo

cd amplified_todo
```

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install aws-amplify amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

You will also need to install the pod dependencies for iOS:

```sh
npx pod-install
```

Start the app with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

```console
r - reload the app
d - open developer menu
i - run on iOS
a - run on Android
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Initialize a new backend

With the app running, it's time to set up Amplify and create the backend services to support the app.

Open a new terminal. From the **amplified_todo** directory, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app, with the option to accept recommended values:

```console
? Enter a name for the project (amplified_todo) 
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: amplified_todo
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react-native
| Source Directory Path: /
| Distribution Directory Path: /
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

> Amplify CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in where possible. Adjust if needed.

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called **amplify** that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the **amplify** folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called **aws-exports.js** in the **root** directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the **.gitignore** file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Set up frontend

Next, configure Amplify so it can interact with backend services.

Open **index.js** (React Native CLI) or **App.js** (Expo CLI) and add the following code below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsExports from './src/aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in **aws-exports.js** will update automatically.

Now that your app is set up and Amplify is initialized, you can add an API in the next step.
