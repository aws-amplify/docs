## What we'll build

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your React Native app. You will create a “Todo app” using Amplify DataStore to store and retrieve items in a cloud database, as well as receive updates over a realtime subscription.

What you will do:

* Set up a React Native application configured with Amplify
* Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
* Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend
