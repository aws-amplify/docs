## Create a new JavaScript app

Create a new ‘plain’ JavaScript <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/" target="_blank">ES2015</a> app with webpack. With the following commands, create the directory (`amplify-js-app`) and files for the app.

```bash
mkdir -p amplify-js-app/src && cd amplify-js-app
touch package.json index.html webpack.config.js src/app.js
```

The app directory structure should be:

```console
amplify-js-app
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── app.js
└── webpack.config.js
```

Add the following to the `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "amplify-js-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Amplify JavaScript Example",
  "dependencies": {
    "aws-amplify": "latest"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^4.17.1",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.1.0",
    "copy-webpack-plugin": "^6.1.0",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.1.5"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack && webpack-dev-server --mode development",
    "build": "webpack"
  }
}
```

### Install local development dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Add the following to the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Amplify Framework</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <style>
      html, body { font-family: "Amazon Ember", "Helvetica", "sans-serif"; margin: 0; }
      a { color: #ff9900; }
      h1 { font-weight: 300; }
      hr { height: 1px; background: lightgray; border: none; }
      .app { width: 100%; }
      .app-header { color: white; text-align: center; background: linear-gradient(30deg, #f90 55%, #ffc300); width: 100%; margin: 0 0 1em 0; padding: 3em 0 3em 0; box-shadow: 1px 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3); }
      .app-logo { width: 126px; margin: 0 auto; }
      .app-body { width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; }
      .app-body button { background-color: #ff9900; font-size: 14px; color: white; text-transform: uppercase; padding: 1em; border: none; }
      .app-body button:hover { opacity: 0.8; }
    </style>
  </head>

  <body>
    <div class="app">
      <div class="app-header">
        <div class="app-logo">
          <img
            src="https://aws-amplify.github.io/images/Logos/Amplify-Logo-White.svg"
            alt="AWS Amplify"
          />
        </div>
        <h1>Welcome to the Amplify Framework</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="app-body">
        <h1>Mutation Results</h1>
        <button id="MutationEventButton">Add data</button>
        <div id="MutationResult"></div>
        <hr />

        <h1>Query Results</h1>
        <div id="QueryResult"></div>
        <hr />

        <h1>Subscription Results</h1>
        <div id="SubscriptionResult"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <script src="main.bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Add the following to the `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    mode: 'development',
    entry: './src/app.js',
    output: {
        filename: '[name].bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
    },
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/
            }
        ]
    },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './dist',
        overlay: true,
        hot: true
    },
    plugins: [
        new CopyWebpackPlugin({
            patterns: ['index.html']
        }),
        new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin()
    ]
};
```

Run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080>.

_(The `Add data` button does not work yet. We'll work on that next!)_

## Initialize a new backend

Now that we have a running app, it's time to set up Amplify so that we can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

```console
Enter a name for the project (amplifyjsapp)

# All AWS services you provision for your app are grouped into an "environment"
# A common naming convention is dev, staging, and production
Enter a name for the environment (dev)

# Sometimes the CLI will prompt you to edit a file, it will use this editor to open those files.
Choose your default editor

# Amplify supports JavaScript (Web & React Native), iOS, and Android apps
Choose the type of app that you're building (javascript)

What JavaScript framework are you using (none)

Source directory path (src)

Distribution directory path (dist)

Build command (npm run-script build)

Start command (npm run-script start)

# This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step.
Do you want to use an AWS profile
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources
