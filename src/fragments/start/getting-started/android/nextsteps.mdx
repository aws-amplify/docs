üëè In this tutorial, you created an application that persists data both locally on the device and in the cloud. 

To begin your production application, continue to the [Project Setup](/lib/project-setup/create-application) guide which will walk you through more details of setting up an Amplify application. Then, you will be ready to start exploring additional Amplify categories to add to your application:

- [Authentication](/lib/auth/getting-started)
- [Storage](/lib/storage/getting-started)
- [DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started)
- [API (GraphQL)](/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started)
- [API (REST)](/lib/restapi/getting-started)
- [Analytics](/lib/analytics/getting-started)
- [Predictions](/lib/predictions/getting-started)
