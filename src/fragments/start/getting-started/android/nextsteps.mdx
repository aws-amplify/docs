üëè In this tutorial, you created an application that persists data both locally on the device and in the cloud.

To begin your production application, continue to the [Project Setup](/gen1/[platform]/start/project-setup/create-application/) guide which will walk you through more details of setting up an Amplify project. Then, you will be ready to start exploring additional Amplify categories to add to your application:
