👋 Welcome! In this tutorial, you will:

- Set up an Android application configured with Amplify
- Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
- Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend

## Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads) version 4.0 or higher
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms) API level 24 (Android 7.0) or higher
- [Amplify CLI](/[platform]/tools/cli) version 4.21.0 or later. Install by running:

import all0 from '/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: all0 }} />

## Create a new Android application

1. Open **Android Studio**. Select **New Project**.

2. Select **Empty Activity**. Press **Next**.

   ![Shows Android studio select project template window](/images/lib/getting-started/android/set-up-android-studio-select-project-template.png)

3. Fill in the following for your project:

   - Name: **Todo**
   - Language: **Kotlin** or **Java**
   - Minimum SDK: **API 24: Android 7.0 (Nougat)**
   - Press **Finish**

You should now have an empty Android project without Amplify.

## Add Amplify to your application

  <Callout>

If you prefer, you can create the Amplify project with [Amplify Studio](https://sandbox.amplifyapp.com/) instead!

  </Callout>

**Amplify Library for Android** is distributed as an Apache Maven package. In this section, you'll add the packages and other required directives to your build configuration.

1. **Open a terminal window** and **change to the directory for your application project**. For example, if you created the previous Todo project in the folder `~/Developer`, you can type the following:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/Todo
```

2. To create the Amplify project, first you will need to use the `amplify` CLI you previously installed. **Run the command**:

```bash
amplify init
```

Enter the following when prompted:

```console
? Enter a name for the project
    `Todo`
? Initialize the project with the above configuration?
    `No`
? Enter a name for the environment
    `dev`
? Choose your default editor:
    `Android Studio`
? Choose the type of app that you're building
    `android`
? Where is your Res directory:
    `app/src/main/res`
? Select the authentication method you want to use:
    `AWS profile`
? Please choose the profile you want to use
    `default`
```

Upon successfully running `amplify init`, you will see a configuration file created in `./app/src/main/res/raw/` called `amplifyconfiguration.json`.

This file will be bundled into your application so that the Amplify libraries know how to reach your provisioned backend resources at runtime.

3. Under **Gradle Scripts**, open **build.gradle (Module :app)**.

Add the following lines:

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        // Support for Java 8 features
        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

dependencies {
    // Amplify API and Datastore dependencies
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:ANDROID_VERSION'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-datastore:ANDROID_VERSION'

    // Support for Java 8 features
    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
}
```

- Set `coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled`, `sourceCompatibility`, and `targetCompatibility` to allow your application to make use of Java 8 features like Lambda expressions
- Add Amplify API, Datastore, and Desugaring libraries to the `dependencies` block

4. Run **Gradle Sync**

   Android Studio requires you to sync your project with your new configuration. To do this, click **Sync Now** in the notification bar above the file editor.

   ![Screenshot with an arrow pointing to the Sync Now button in the file's notification bar](/images/lib/getting-started/android/set-up-android-studio-sync-gradle.png)

   When complete, you will see _BUILD SUCCESSFUL_ in the output in the _Build_ tab at the bottom of your screen.

You are ready to start building with Amplify! 🎉
