ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! In this tutorial, you will:

- Set up an iOS application configured with Amplify
- Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
- Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12.x or higher
- Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) version 11.4 or later
- Install [Amplify CLI](/cli) version 4.22.0 or later by running:

  

import all0 from "/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />

## Set up your application

### Create a new iOS application

1. **Open Xcode.** From the menu bar, select **"File -> New -> Project..."**

2. Select **App**, and then select the **Next** button.

1. Fill in the following for your project:
  * Product Name: **Todo**
  * Interface: **SwiftUI**
  * Life Cycle: **SwiftUI App** (only relevant if Xcode 12 is being used)
  * Language: **Swift**
  * Select the **Next** button

1. After selecting **Next**, **select where you would like to save your project**, and then select **Create**.

  You should now have an empty iOS project without Amplify.

### Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for iOS is distributed through Swift Package Manager, which is integrated into Xcode. In this section, you'll add the required Amplify packages.

1. **Open a terminal window** and **change to the directory for your Todo project**. For example, if you created your project in the folder `~/Developer`, you can type the following:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Developer/Todo
  ```

1. To create the Amplify app first you will need to use the `amplify` CLI you previously installed. **Run the command**:
  ```bash
  amplify init --quickstart --frontend ios
  ```

1. Switch back to Xcode. Select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.

1. Enter the Amplify iOS GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios`) into the search bar and click Next.

1. You'll see the Amplify iOS repository rules for which version of Amplify you want Swift Package Manager to install. Choose the first rule, **Version**, as it will use the latest compatible version of the dependency that can be detected from the `main` branch, then click **Next**.

1. Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. For this tutorial, select **Amplify**, **AWSAPIPlugin**, and **AWSDataStorePlugin**, then click **Finish**.

You can always go back and modify which SPM packages are included in your project by opening the Swift Packages tab for your project (`Project file > Project > Swift Packages`)

You are ready to start building with Amplify! ðŸŽ‰
