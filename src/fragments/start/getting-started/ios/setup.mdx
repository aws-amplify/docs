ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! In this tutorial, you will:

- Set up an iOS application configured with Amplify
- Create a data model and persist data to Amplify DataStore
- Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend

## Prerequisites

import ios0 from '/src/fragments/lib/ios-prereq-xcode.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios0 }} />

- [Amplify CLI](/cli) version 10 or later. Install by running:

import all0 from '/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: all0 }} />

## Create a new iOS application

1. **Open Xcode.** From the menu bar, select **"File -> New -> Project..."**

2. Select **iOS** tab, choose Application type as **App**, and then click on **Next**. ![](/images/lib/getting-started/ios/set-up-ios-select-project-template.png)

3. Fill in the following for your project:

- Product Name: **Todo**
- Interface: **SwiftUI**
- Language: **Swift**
- Select the **Next** button

After selecting **Next**, **select where you would like to save your project**, and then select **Create**. You should now have an empty iOS project without Amplify.

## Add Amplify to your application

**Amplify Library for Swift** is distributed through Swift Package Manager, which is integrated into Xcode. In this section, you'll add the required Amplify packages.

1. **Open a terminal window** and **change to the directory for your application project**. For example, if you created the previous Todo project in the folder `~/Developer`, you can type the following:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/Todo
```

1. To create the Amplify project first you will need to use the `amplify` CLI you previously installed. **Run the command**:

```bash
amplify init --quickstart --frontend ios
```

1. Switch back to Xcode. Select **File > Add Packages...**

1. Enter the **Amplify Library for Swift** GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**.

   Once the result is loaded, choose **Up to Next Major Version** as the Dependency Rule, then click **Add Package**.

1. Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. For this tutorial, select **AWSAPIPlugin**, **AWSDataStorePlugin**, and **Amplify**, then click **Add Package**.

You are now ready to start building with Amplify! ðŸŽ‰

You can always modify which packages are included in your project by opening the **Package Dependencies** tab under the project settings.

Click the `Todo` project in the **Project Navigator** to open the **Project Editor**, select `Todo` under **Project** and then click on the **Package Dependencies** tab.
