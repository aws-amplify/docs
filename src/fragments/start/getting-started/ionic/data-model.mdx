### Model the data with GraphQL transform

Add a [GraphQL API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html) to your app and automatically provision a database by running the following command from the root of your application directory:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Accept the **default values** which are highlighted below:

```console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services:
# GraphQL
? Provide API name:
# myapi
? Choose the default authorization type for the API:
# API Key
? Enter a description for the API key:
# demo
? After how many days from now the API key should expire:
# 7 (or your preferred expiration)
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API:
# No
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema?
# No
? Choose a schema template: 
# Single object with fields
? Do you want to edit the schema now?
# Yes
```

The CLI should open this GraphQL schema in your text editor.

__amplify/backend/api/myapi/schema.graphql__

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

The schema generated is for a Todo app. You'll notice a directive on the `Todo` type of `@model`. This directive is part of the [GraphQL transform](/cli/graphql-transformer/model) library of Amplify. 

The GraphQL Transform Library provides custom directives you can use in your schema that allow you to do things like define data models, set up authentication and authorization rules, configure serverless functions as resolvers, and more.

A type decorated with the `@model` directive will scaffold out the database table for the type (Todo table), the schema for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and list operations, and the GraphQL resolvers needed to make everything work together.

From the command line, press __enter__ to accept the schema and continue to the next steps.

## Create GraphQL API and database

Create required backend resources for your configured api with the following command:

```bash
amplify push
```

### Code generation

Since you added an API the `amplify push` process will automatically prompt for codegen (select `y` when prompted for automatic query and code generation). For Ionic applications, choose **Angular** which will create an `API.service.ts` file in the app directory.

Next, run the following command to check Amplify's status:

```bash
amplify status
```

This will give us the current status of the Amplify project, including the current environment, any categories that have been created, and what state those categories are in. It should look similar to this:

```console
Current Environment: dev

| Category | Resource name | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Api      | myapi         | No Change | awscloudformation |
```

### Test your API

You can open the AWS console to run Queries, Mutation, or Subscription against your new API at any time directly by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console api
```

When prompted, select **GraphQL**. This will open the AWS AppSync console for you to run Queries, Mutations, or Subscriptions at the server and see the changes in your client app.

## Connect frontend to API

Update __src/main.ts__ to configure the library:

```javascript
import Amplify from "aws-amplify";
import aws_exports from "./aws-exports";

Amplify.configure(aws_exports);
```

When working with underlying `aws-js-sdk`, the "node" package should be included in *types* compiler option. update your `src/tsconfig.app.json`:

```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "types" : ["node"]
}
```

Note: If you are using Angular 6 or above, you may need to add the following to the top of your `src/polyfills.ts` file:
```
(window as any).global = window;

(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

In your `src/app/app.component.ts` file, add the following imports and modifications to your class to to add data to your database with a mutation by using the `API.service` file which was generated when you ran `amplify add api`:

```javascript
import { APIService } from './API.service';

constructor(
    //other variables
    private apiService: APIService
  ){  
    this.initializeApp();
  }

  createTodo() {
    this.apiService.CreateTodo({
        name: 'ionic',
        description: 'testing'
    });
  }
```

Next, update `initializeApp()` in `src/app/app.component.ts` to list all items in the database by running a query on start and populating a local variable called `todos`:

```javascript
export class AppComponent {
  todos: Array<any>;

  initializeApp() {
    this.platform.ready().then(() => {
      //other code
      this.apiService.ListTodos().then((evt) => {
        this.todos = evt.items;
      });
    });
  }
}
```

Update the code in `src/app/app.component.html` with the following to display the list of todos:

```html
<ion-app>
  <ion-button (click)="createTodo()">Add Data</ion-button>
  <ion-list>
    <ion-item *ngFor="let item of todos">
      <p>{{item.name}} - {{item.description}}</p>
    </ion-item>
  </ion-list>
</ion-app>

```

Finally, to subscribe to realtime data, update `initializeApp()` to setup a subscription on app start and update the `todos` array when new events are received:

```javascript
initializeApp() {
  this.platform.ready().then(() => {
    //other code
    this.apiService.OnCreateTodoListener.subscribe((evt) => {
      const data = (evt as any).value.data.onCreateTodo;
      this.todos = [...this.todos, data];
    });
  }
}
```

> The code above imports only the API and PubSub category. To import the entire Amplify library use `import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'`. However, importing only the required categories is recommended as it will greatly reduce the final bundle size.

After restarting your app using `npm start` go back to your browser and using dev tools you will see data being stored and retrieved in your backend from the console logs.
