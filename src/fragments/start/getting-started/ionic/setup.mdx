To set up the project, we'll first create a new Ionic app with the Ionic CLI. We'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

From your projects directory, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g ionic
ionic start myAmplifyProject blank --type=angular
cd myAmplifyProject
npm start
```

This runs a development server and allows us to see the output generated by the build, you can see the running app by navigating to `localhost`.

## Initialize a new backend

Now that we have a running Ionic app, it's time to set up Amplify so that we can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

```console
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project todo
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: todo
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: angular
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: www
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: ng serve

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? (Y/n) Y
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Install Amplify libraries

Make sure to install the latest version of the `aws-amplify` core and the `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` library.

```sh
$ npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-angular
```

The `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` package is a set of Angular components and an Angular provider which helps integrate your application with the `aws-amplify` library.
