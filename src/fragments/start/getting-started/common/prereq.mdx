## Sign up for an AWS account

If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial.

[Create AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)

> There are no upfront charges or any term commitments to create an AWS account and signing up gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier.

## Install and configure the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

### Option 1: Watch the video guide

Watch the video below to learn how to install and configure the Amplify CLI or skip to the next section to follow the step-by-step instructions.

### Option 2: Follow the instructions

import all0 from "/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />

Now it's time to setup the Amplify CLI. Configure Amplify by running the following command:

```bash
amplify configure
```

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.

Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user.
> Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. You can learn more about Amazon IAM [here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

```console
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Specify the username of the new IAM user:
? user name:  # User name for Amplify IAM user
Complete the user creation using the AWS console
```

Create a user with `AdministratorAccess` to your account to provision AWS resources for you like AppSync, Cognito etc.

Once the user is created, Amplify CLI will ask you to provide the `accessKeyId` and the `secretAccessKey` to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user.

```console
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

Next, we'll set up the app and initialize Amplify!
