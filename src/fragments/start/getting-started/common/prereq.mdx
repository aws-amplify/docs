## Sign up for an AWS account

If you don't already have an AWS account, you'll need to create one in order to follow the steps outlined in this tutorial.

> There are no upfront charges or any term commitments to create an AWS account and signing up gives you immediate access to the AWS Free Tier.

## Install the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

import all0 from '/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: all0 }} />

import config from '/src/fragments/cli-config.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: config }} />

Successfully set up the new user.
