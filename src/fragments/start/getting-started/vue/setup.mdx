Use the Vue CLI to bootstrap a new Vue 3 app (selecting the defaults will work for this project):

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="NPM">

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
vue create myamplifyproject

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Default (Vue 3 Preview) ([Vue 3] babel, eslint)  <--
  Manually select features

cd myamplifyproject
```

Install required modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Run your app:

```bash
npm run serve --open
```
Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

</Block>
<Block name="Yarn">

```bash
yarn global add @vue/cli
vue create myamplifyproject

? Please pick a preset: (Use arrow keys)
❯ default (babel, eslint)   <--
  Manually select features

cd myamplifyproject
```

Install required modules:

```bash
yarn
```

Run your app:

```bash
yarn serve --open
```
Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Initialize a new backend

Now that we have a running Vue app, it's time to set up Amplify so that we can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app:

Your backend needs a project name to use when creating resources.
Give your backend project the name `todo`
```console
? Enter a name for the project (myamplifyproject) todo
```

All AWS services you provision for your app are grouped into an "environment"
A common naming convention is dev, staging, and production

Set the backend environment name to be `dev`
```console
? Enter a name for the environment dev
```

Sometimes the CLI will prompt you to edit a file, it will use this editor to open those files.
Select your preferred code editor software
```console
? Choose your default editor: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Visual Studio Code
  Atom Editor
  Sublime Text
  IntelliJ IDEA
  Vim (via Terminal, Mac OS only)
  Emacs (via Terminal, Mac OS only)
  None
```

Amplify will provide configuration files for your frontend application to connect to this backend environment. Since Vue is based on Javascript, we'll select that here.
Select the javascript framework for your backend integration
```console
# Amplify supports JavaScript (Web & React Native), iOS, and Android apps
? Choose the type of app that you're building (Use arrow keys)
  android
  ios
❯ javascript
```

```console
? What JavaScript framework are you using (Use arrow keys)
  angular
  ember
  ionic
  react
  react-native
❯ vue
  none
```

Vue CLI setup the source files for your project under a `./src` folder. Other tools, such as `Nuxt`, place the source files in the root directory. For this tutorial, we'll go with the default, `src`
```console
? Source Directory Path:  src
```

When your project is ready to be hosted, Vue will generate your website, ready for public use, into a folder called `dist`. This is the default, so you can just press enter to continue.
```console
? Distribution Directory Path:  dist
```

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="NPM">

Amplify's automated deployment needs to know what steps are needed to build your application for publishing. Here we will set that to be Vue CLI's default build script, found in the `package.json`
```console
? Build Command:  npm run-script build
```

If Amplify needs to run the application in development mode, it needs to know how to start the development server. Again, we'll use Vue CLI's default scripts.
```console
? Start Command:  npm run-script serve
```
</Block>
<Block name="Yarn">

Finally, Amplify needs an AWS account to connect to so that it can begin creating the backend services.
This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step. [introduction step](/start/getting-started/installation)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="With A Profile">

Select "yes" by typing `y` and pressing `enter`.

```console
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? (Y/n)
```
Proceed to select your profile from the list and press enter. Amplify will now begin deploying your backend framework.

</Block>
<Block name="Without A Profile">

If you have not setup an AWS profile yet, select "no" by typing `n` and pressing `enter`.

```console
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? (Y/n)
```

You will now be prompted for an Access Key and Secret Key for your AWS account. Fill in these details and press enter.

```console
? accessKeyId:  (<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>)
? secretAccessKey:  (<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>)
```

AWS has multiple regions distributed around the world. Select the region that makes sense for your application to run in. For this tutorial, the closer the region is to you, the better your experience will be.

```console
? region:  (Use arrow keys)
❯ us-east-1 
  us-east-2 
  us-west-2 
  eu-west-1 
  eu-west-2 
  eu-central-1 
  ap-northeast-1 
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

Amplify will now begin deploying your backend framework.

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

## Install Amplify libraries

The first step to using Amplify in the client is to install the necessary dependencies:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="NPM">

```
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-vue
```

</Block>
<Block name="Yarn">

```
yarn add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-vue
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

<Callout>

If you are using Vue 2, please check out our legacy [documentation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/tree/legacy/legacy/amplify-ui-vue). For Vite installs check out this [documentation](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/vue/getting-started/installation#vite). 

</Callout>

The `@aws-amplify/ui-vue` package is a set of components that make it easy to integrate functionality like end-to-end authentication flows. 

# Set up frontend

Next, we need to configure Amplify on the client so that we can use it to interact with our backend services.

Open __src/main.js__ and add the following code below the last import:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsExports from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsExports);
```

And that's all it takes to configure Amplify. As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in __aws-exports.js__ will update automatically.

Now that our Vue app is set up and Amplify is initialized, we're ready to add an API in the next step.
