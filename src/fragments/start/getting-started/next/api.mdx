Now that you’ve created and configured a Next.js app and initialized a new Amplify project, you can add a feature. The first feature you will add is an API.

The Amplify CLI supports creating and interacting with two types of API categories: REST and GraphQL.

The API you will be creating in this step is a GraphQL API using AWS AppSync (a managed GraphQL service) and the database will be Amazon DynamoDB (a NoSQL database).

## Create a GraphQL API and database

Add a [GraphQL API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html) to your app and automatically provision a database by running the following command from the root of your application directory:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Select the explicit values below to enable **API key** (for public read access) and **Cognito User Pools** (for authenticated access).

```console
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: GraphQL
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue Continue
? Choose a schema template: Single object with fields (e.g., “Todo” with ID, name, description)

⚠️  WARNING: your GraphQL API currently allows public create, read, update, and delete access to all models via an API Key. To configure PRODUCTION-READY authorization rules, review: https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/

✅ GraphQL schema compiled successfully.

Edit your schema at <path-to-project>/next-amplified/amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema.graphql or place .graphql files in a directory at <path-to-project>/next-amplified/amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema
✔ Do you want to edit the schema now? (Y/n) · yes
Edit the file in your editor: <path-to-project>/next-amplified/amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema.graphql
✅ Successfully added resource nextamplified locally

✅ Some next steps:
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

```

The CLI will open this GraphQL schema in your text editor. Replace the example schema with the `Todo` model below.

**amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema.graphql**

```graphql
# This "input" configures a global authorization rule to enable public access to
# all models in this schema. Learn more about authorization rules here: https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/
input AMPLIFY {
  globalAuthRule: AuthRule = { allow: public }
} # FOR TESTING ONLY!
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

The schema generated is for a blog app. You'll notice a directive on the `Post` type of `@model`. This directive is part of the [GraphQL transform](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/data-modeling/) library of Amplify.

The GraphQL Transform Library provides custom directives you can use in your schema that allow you to do things like define data models, set up authentication and authorization rules, configure serverless functions as resolvers, and more.

A type decorated with the `@model` directive will scaffold out the database table for the type (Todo table), the schema for CRUD (create, read, update, delete) and list operations, and the GraphQL resolvers needed to make everything work together.

### Deploying the API

To deploy this backend, run the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

```console
⠧ Fetching updates to backend environment: dev from the cloud.⠋ Building resource api/ne⠙ Fetching updates to backend environment: dev from the cloud.

✔ Successfully pulled backend environment dev from the cloud.
⠹ Building resource api/nextamplified
⚠️  WARNING: your GraphQL API currently allows public create, read, update, and delete access to all models via an API Key. To configure PRODUCTION-READY authorization rules, review: https://docs.amplify.aws/nextjs/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/

✅ GraphQL schema compiled successfully.

Edit your schema at <path-to-project>/next-amplified/amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema.graphql or place .graphql files in a directory at <path-to-project>/next-amplified/amplify/backend/api/nextamplified/schema

? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API Yes
? Choose the code generation language target javascript
? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions src/graphql/**/*.js
? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions Yes
? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] 2

```

Now the API is live and you can start interacting with it!

The API you have deployed includes operations for creating, reading, updating, deleting, and listing posts.

Next, run the following command to check Amplify's status:

```bash
amplify status
```

This will give us the current status of the Amplify project, including the current environment, any categories that have been created, and what state those categories are in. It should look similar to this:

```console

    Current Environment: dev

┌──────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────┬───────────────────┐
│ Category │ Resource name         │ Operation │ Provider plugin   │
├──────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Auth     │ nextamplifiedXXXXXXXX │ No Change │ awscloudformation │
├──────────┼───────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────────────┤
│ Api      │ nextamplified         │ No Change │ awscloudformation │
└──────────┴───────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────────────┘
```

To view the GraphQL API in the AppSync console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console api
```

To view your entire app in the Amplify console at any time, run the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

### (Optional) Test your API

To test this out locally, you can run the `mock` command. Note: Refer to the [instructions to setup mocking](/[platform]/tools/cli/usage/mock/).

> If you'd like to go ahead and connect the front end, you can [jump to the next step](#connect-frontend-to-api).

```bash
amplify mock api
```

_Note:_ `amplify mock api` requires Java.

```console
# If you have not already deployed your API, you will be walked through the following steps for GraphQL code generation
? Choose the code generation language target: javascript (or preferred target)
? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions: src/graphql/**/*.js
? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions: Yes
? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] 2
```

This will open the GraphiQL explorer on a local port. From the test environment you can try out different operations locally, like queries and mutations.

In the GraphiQL toolbar, select **Use: User Pool** and try creating a todo:

```graphql
mutation CreateTodo {
  createTodo(input: { name: "Test Todo", description: "todo description" }) {
    id
    owner
    name
    updatedAt
    createdAt
    description
  }
}
```

Next, update auth to **Use: API Key** and try querying the list of todos:

```graphql
query ListTodos {
  listTodos {
    items {
      id
      name
      description
      createdAt
      owner
    }
  }
}
```

## API with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

In this section you will create a way to list and create todos from the Next.js application. To do this, you will fetch & render the latest todos from the server as well as create a new todo.

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```sh
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react
```

Open **app/\_layout.ts** and add the following code to import styles from [Amplify UI](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws).

```jsx
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';
```

Open **app/page.tsx** and replace it with the following code:

```jsx
// app/page.tsx
import { generateServerClientUsingCookies } from '@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs/api';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

import * as mutations from '@/src/graphql/mutations';
import * as queries from '@/src/graphql/queries';

import config from '@/src/amplifyconfiguration.json';

export const cookiesClient = generateServerClientUsingCookies({
  config,
  cookies
});

async function createTodo(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';

  await cookiesClient.graphql({
    query: mutations.createTodo,
    variables: {
      input: {
        name: formData.get('name')?.toString() ?? ''
      }
    }
  });

  revalidatePath('/');
}

export default async function Home() {
  const { data, errors } = await cookiesClient.graphql({
    query: queries.listTodos
  });

  const todos = data.listTodos.items;

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        maxWidth: '500px',
        margin: '0 auto',
        textAlign: 'center',
        marginTop: '100px'
      }}
    >
      <form action={createTodo}>
        <input name="name" placeholder="Add a todo" />
        <button type="submit">Add</button>
      </form>

      {(!todos || todos.length === 0 || errors) && (
        <div>
          <p>No todos, please add one.</p>
        </div>
      )}

      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo) => {
          return <li style={{ listStyle: 'none' }}>{todo.name}</li>;
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Let's walk through some of this file:

- First we import `generateServerClientUsingCookies` from `@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs/api` and use it to generate a `cookiesClient` using the `amplifyconfiguration.json` in our project as `config` and `cookies` from `@next/headers`.

- Using `cookiesClient.graphql` we call `queries.listTodos` and await the response and assign the items returned to `todos` then iterate over them to display. If there are no todos, display the message "No todos, please add one".

- The form above the list of todos is a [Server-only form in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/forms-and-mutations#server-only-forms) which submits it's data to the `createTodo` async function. When called, `createTodo` sends a mutation via `cookiesClient.graphql` to the GraphQL API, then calls `revalidatePath` from the Next.js cache to invalidate the page cache and fetch the latest todos.

## Testing SSR

Next, run the app and you should see a form to add a todo and "There are no todos right now.":

```bash
npm run dev
```

Add text to the form and click the `Add` button to create a todo and it will be appended to the list.
