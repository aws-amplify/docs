Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new amplify-app
```

```console
? Would you like to add Angular routing? Y
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (your preferred stylesheet provider)
```

```bash
cd amplify-app
```

## Create a new Amplify backend

Now that you have a running Angular app, it's time to set up Amplify for this app so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. 

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app.  For newer versions of Angular, you will have to change the Distribution Directory Path from `dist` to `dist/amplify-app` to match how Angular will build your project.

```console
? Enter a name for the project: amplifyapp
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: amplifyapp
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: angular
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: dist
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: ng serve

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use: default
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list.
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources.

## Install Amplify libraries

Inside the `amplify-app` directory, install the Amplify Angular library and run your app:

```bash
npm install --save aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-angular

npm start
```

The `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` package is a set of Angular components and an Angular provider which helps integrate your application with the AWS-Amplify library.

Angular CLI output warnings: if you see CommonJS or AMD dependencies optimization bailouts warnings using Angular 9+, you can use this [gist](https://gist.github.com/wlee221/6d98d96740bea6f53327b4db4a432616) to remove them.

### Importing the Amplify Angular UI Module

Add the **Amplify Authenticator UI Module** to `src/app/app.module.ts`:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AmplifyAuthenticatorModule } from '@aws-amplify/ui-angular';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    /* configure App with AmplifyAuthenticatorModule */
    AmplifyAuthenticatorModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```
