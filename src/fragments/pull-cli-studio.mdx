Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you would like to have Amplify setup your project.
To initialize Amplify in the current directory, run the following command. Replace the `xxx` values with your unique `appId` and `envName`. 
```bash
amplify pull --appId xxx --envName xxx
```
A browser window opens and prompts you to continue logging in to the Amplify CLI. Choose **Yes**.
