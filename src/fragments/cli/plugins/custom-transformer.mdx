## Authoring custom GraphQL transformers & directives

This section outlines the process of writing custom GraphQL transformers. The `@aws-amplify/graphql-transformer-core` package serves as a lightweight framework that takes as input a GraphQL SDL document and a list of **GraphQL Transformers** and returns a set of deployment resources that fully implements the data model defined by the input schema. A GraphQL Transformer is a class that defines a directive and a set of functions that manipulate a context and are called whenever that directive is found in an input schema.

For example, the AWS Amplify CLI calls the GraphQL Transform like this:

```ts
import { GraphQLTransform } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-transformer-core';
import { FeatureFlagProvider, TransformerPluginProvider } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-transformer-interfaces';
import { AuthTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-auth-transformer';
import { BelongsToTransformer, HasManyTransformer, HasOneTransformer, ManyToManyTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-relational-transformer';
import { DefaultValueTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-default-value-transformer';
import { FunctionTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-function-transformer';
import { HttpTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-http-transformer';
import { IndexTransformer, PrimaryKeyTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-index-transformer';
import { ModelTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-model-transformer';
import { PredictionsTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-predictions-transformer';
import { SearchableModelTransformer } from '@aws-amplify/graphql-searchable-transformer';

// This adapter class supports the propagation of feature flag values from the CLI to the transformers
class TransformerFeatureFlagAdapter implements FeatureFlagProvider {
  getBoolean(featureName: string, defaultValue?: boolean): boolean {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
  }
  getString(featureName: string, defaultValue?: string): string {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
  }
  getNumber(featureName: string, defaultValue?: number): number {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
  }
  getObject(featureName: string, defaultValue?: object): object {
    throw new Error('Method not implemented.');
  }
}

const modelTransformer = new ModelTransformer();
const indexTransformer = new IndexTransformer();
const hasOneTransformer = new HasOneTransformer();
const authTransformer = new AuthTransformer({
  authConfig: {
    defaultAuthentication: {
      authenticationType: 'API_KEY',
    },
    additionalAuthenticationProviders: [
      {
        authenticationType: 'AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS',
        userPoolConfig: {
          userPoolId: 'us-east-1_abcdefghi',
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  addAwsIamAuthInOutputSchema: true,
});

const transformers: TransformerPluginProvider[] = [
  modelTransformer,
  new FunctionTransformer(),
  new HttpTransformer(),
  new PredictionsTransformer(),
  new PrimaryKeyTransformer(),
  indexTransformer,
  new BelongsToTransformer(),
  new HasManyTransformer(),
  hasOneTransformer,
  new ManyToManyTransformer(modelTransformer, indexTransformer, hasOneTransformer, authTransformer),
  new DefaultValueTransformer(),
  authTransformer,
  new SearchableModelTransformer(),
];

const graphQLTransform = new GraphQLTransform  ({
  transformers,
  featureFlags: new TransformerFeatureFlagAdapter(),
  sandboxModeEnabled: false,
});

const schema = `
type Post @model {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
    comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}
type Comment @model {
    id: ID!
    content: String!
    post: Post @belongsTo
}
`;

const { rootStack, stacks, schema } = graphQLTransform.transform(schema);

console.log('Schema compiled successfully.')
```

As shown above the `GraphQLTransform` class takes a list of transformers and later is able to transform
GraphQL SDL documents into deployment resources, this includes the transformed GraphQL schema, CloudFormation templates, AppSync service resolvers, etc.

### The Transform Lifecycle

At a high level the `GraphQLTransform` takes the input SDL, parses it, and validates the schema is complete and satisfies the directive definitions. It then iterates through the list of transformers passed to the transform when it was created.

In order to support inter communication/dependency between these classes of transformers, the transformation will be done in phases.
The table below shows the lifecycle methods that a transformer plugin can implement to handle different phases in the execution of the transformer:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colSpan="2">Lifecycle method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">before</td>
      <td>initialization of the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowSpan="10">GraphQL visitor pattern functions</td>
      <td>object</td>
      <td>for each type that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>interface</td>
      <td>for each interface that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>field</td>
      <td>for each field that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>argument</td>
      <td>for each argument that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>union</td>
      <td>for each union that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>enum</td>
      <td>for each enum that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>enumValue</td>
      <td>for each enumValue that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>scalar</td>
      <td>for each scalar that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>input</td>
      <td>for each input that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>inputValue</td>
      <td>for each inputValue that has the directive defined by the transformer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">prepare</td>
      <td>transformer register themselves in the `TransformerContext` (as data provider or data enhancer)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">validate</td>
      <td>transformer validates the directive arguments</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">transformSchema</td>
      <td>transformer updates/augments the output schema</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">generateResolvers</td>
      <td>transformer generates resources such as resolvers, IAM policies, Tables, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colSpan="2">after</td>
      <td>cleanup, this lifecycle method is invoked in reverse order for the registered transformers</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


Here is pseudo code for how `const { rootStack, stacks, schema } = graphQLTransform.transform(schema);` works.

```ts
public transform(schema: string): DeploymentResources {

  // ...

  for (const transformer of this.transformers) {
    // Run the prepare function one time per transformer.
    if (isFunction(transformer.before)) {
      transformer.before(context);
    }

    // Transform each definition in the input document.
    for (const def of context.inputDocument.definitions as TypeDefinitionNode[]) {
      switch (def.kind) {
        case 'ObjectTypeDefinition':
          this.transformObject(transformer, def, context);
          // Walk the fields and call field transformers.
          break;
        case 'InterfaceTypeDefinition':
          this.transformInterface(transformer, def, context);
          // Walk the fields and call field transformers.
          break;
        case 'ScalarTypeDefinition':
          this.transformScalar(transformer, def, context);
          break;
        case 'UnionTypeDefinition':
          this.transformUnion(transformer, def, context);
          break;
        case 'EnumTypeDefinition':
          this.transformEnum(transformer, def, context);
          break;
        case 'InputObjectTypeDefinition':
          this.transformInputObject(transformer, def, context);
          break;
        // Note: Extension and operation definition nodes are not supported.
        default:
          continue;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Validate
  for (const transformer of this.transformers) {
    if (isFunction(transformer.validate)) {
      transformer.validate(context);
    }
  }

  // Prepare
  for (const transformer of this.transformers) {
    if (isFunction(transformer.prepare)) {
      transformer.prepare(context);
    }
  }

  // Transform Schema
  for (const transformer of this.transformers) {
    if (isFunction(transformer.transformSchema)) {
      transformer.transformSchema(context);
    }
  }

  // After is called in the reverse order as if they were popping off a stack.
  let reverseThroughTransformers = this.transformers.length - 1;
  while (reverseThroughTransformers >= 0) {
    const transformer = this.transformers[reverseThroughTransformers];
    if (isFunction(transformer.after)) {
      transformer.after(context);
    }

    reverseThroughTransformers -= 1;
  }

  // ...

  // Return the deployment resources.
  // In the future there will likely be a formatter concept here.
  return this.synthesize(context);
}
```

### The Transformer Context

The transformer context serves like an accumulator that is manipulated by transformers. See the [code](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/blob/main/packages/amplify-graphql-transformer-core/src/transformer-context/index.ts) to see what methods are available
to you.

> For now, the transformer only support CloudFormation and uses [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) to create CloudFormation resources in code.

### Adding Custom GraphQL Transformers to the Project
To add a custom GraphQL transformer to the list of transformers, they need to be registered within the project. This registration can be done by adding an entry to ```transform.conf.json``` file which can be found in the ```amplify/backend/api/<api-name>``` folder. A transformer can be registered by adding a file URI to the JavaScript file that implements the transformer or by specifying the npm package name. The transformer modules will be dynamically imported during the transform process.

#### Example `transform.conf.json` file
```json
{
    "transformers":[
        "some-transformer-via-npm",
        "file:///some/absolute/local/module"
    ]
}
```

### Example

As an example let's walk through how we implemented the [`@model`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/blob/main/packages/amplify-graphql-model-transformer/src/graphql-model-transformer.ts) transformer. The first thing to do is to define a directive for your transformer.

> Note: Some parts of the code will not be shown for brevity.

```ts
export const directiveDefinition = /* GraphQL */ `
  directive @model(
    queries: ModelQueryMap
    mutations: ModelMutationMap
    subscriptions: ModelSubscriptionMap
    timestamps: TimestampConfiguration
  ) on OBJECT
`;
```

Our `@model` directive can be applied to `OBJECT` type definitions and automatically adds CRUD functionality, timestamp fields to an API. For example, we might write:

```graphql
type Post @model {
    id: ID!
    title: String!
}
```

The next step after defining the directive is to implement the transformer's business logic. The `@aws-amplify/graphql-transformer-core` package makes this a little easier
by exporting a common class through which we may define transformers. Users extend the [`TransformerPluginBase`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/blob/main/packages/amplify-graphql-transformer-core/src/transformation/transformer-plugin-base.ts) class and implement the required functions.

> Note: In this example `@model` extended from a higher level class, [`TransformerModelBase`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/blob/main/packages/amplify-graphql-transformer-core/src/transformation/transformer-plugin-base.ts).

```ts
export class ModelTransformer extends TransformerModelBase implements TransformerModelProvider {
  // ...
}
```

Since your `directiveDefinition` only specifies `OBJECT` in its **on** condition, we have to implement the `object` method and some other
 lifecycle methods like `validate`, `prepare` and `transformSchema` to have a fully functioning transformer. You may implement `before` and `after` methods which will be called once at the beginning and end respectively of the transformation process.

```ts
/**
 * Users extend the TransformerPluginBase class and implement the relevant functions.
 */
export class ModelTransformer extends TransformerModelBase implements TransformerModelProvider {
  constructor(options: ModelTransformerOptions = {}) {
    super('amplify-model-transformer', directiveDefinition);
  }

  // ...
}
```

The following snippet shows the `prepare` method implementation which takes all the type from the GraphQL schema and registers the transformer as a data source provider. Data source providers are used by transformers that are creating persistent resources like DynamoDB tables in this case. `prepare` is the place to register data enhancers as well. Data enhancers are used by transformers that enriching existing types or operations by adding or modifying fields, arguments, etc.

```ts
  prepare = (context: TransformerPrepareStepContextProvider) => {
    for (const modelTypeName of this.typesWithModelDirective) {
      const type = context.output.getObject(modelTypeName);
      context.providerRegistry.registerDataSourceProvider(type!, this);
    }
  };
```
