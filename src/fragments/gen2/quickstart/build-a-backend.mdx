## Build a backend

Next, we will add data and auth capabilities to the app.  In Amplify Gen 2, the `resource.ts` files are where you _define_ the corresponding backend resource and details about it.

### Add data

`create-amplify` provides the scaffolding of a `amplify/data/resource.ts` file, which is ready to deploy.

<Accordion title="See the complete amplify/data/resources.ts">

Open the `amplify/data/resource.ts` file in your text editor, and you will see a default data model generated for you.

_Note: The steps defined in the code below do not require action to complete this quickstart. These notes are provided for every new app and will help you when you build your next app on your own._

```ts showLineNumbers title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

/*== STEP 1 ===============================================================
The section below creates a Todo database table with a "content" field. Try
adding a new "isDone" field as a boolean. The authorization rules below
specify that owners, authenticated via your Auth resource, can "create",
"read", "update", and "delete" their own records. Public users,
authenticated via an API key, can only "read" records.
=========================================================================*/
const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string()
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.owner(), allow.publicApiKey().to(['read'])])
});

export type Schema = ClientSchema<typeof schema>;

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'apiKey',
    // API Key is used for allow.publicApiKey() rules
    apiKeyAuthorizationMode: {
      expiresInDays: 30
    }
  }
});

/*== STEP 2 ===============================================================
Go to your frontend source code. From your client-side code, generate a
Data client to make CRUDL requests to your table. (THIS SNIPPET WILL ONLY
WORK IN THE FRONTEND CODE FILE.)

Using JavaScript or Next.js React Server Components, Middleware, Server
Actions, or Pages Router? Review how to generate Data clients for those use
cases: https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/connect-to-API/
=========================================================================*/

/*
"use client"
import { generateClient } from "aws-amplify/data";
import { type Schema } from "@/amplify/data/resource";

const client = generateClient<Schema>() // use this Data client for CRUDL requests
*/

/*== STEP 3 ===============================================================
Fetch records from the database and use them in your frontend component.
(THIS SNIPPET WILL ONLY WORK IN THE FRONTEND CODE FILE.)
=========================================================================*/

/* For example, in a React component, you can use this snippet in your
  function's RETURN statement */
// const { data: todos } = client.models.Todo.list()

// return <ul>{todos.map(todo => <li key={todo.id}>{todo.content}</li>)}</ul>
```

  The schema generated by Amplify is for a to-do app. A schema is a blueprint
  for how our app's data will be organized. Within the schema, we will define
  models that will correspond to a database table—`Todo` in the above code.
  Finally, we will define fields, which are attributes that each data instance
  will have—in the generated code, the field is `content`. Each
  field will have a type attached to it—in the above examples, we are stating
  that the `content` field is a string.
</Accordion>


<b>Step 1:</b> Open `amplify/data/resource.ts` and update it to add a `done` field of type `boolean` and a `priority` field of `enum` with a value of `['low', 'medium', 'high']`. We've removed the default comments to shorten the code below for the next few examples.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
import { type ClientSchema, a, defineData } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

// ...

const schema = a.schema({
  Todo: a
    .model({
      content: a.string(),
// highlight-start
      done: a.boolean(),
      priority: a.enum(['low', 'medium', 'high'])
// highlight-end
    })
    .authorization(allow => [allow.owner(), allow.publicApiKey().to(['read'])]),
});

// ...
```

Once you save your changes to the data model, they will be deployed in seconds to your cloud sandbox.


The `Todo` data model is defined with authorization rules to allow the person who creates the Todo instance (the owner) to perform all actions on the data they own. We are also allowing all page viewers, including unauthenticated users, to read data.

<Callout>
**Note:** These authorization rules can be modified using a chain of methods as defined by default. For example, we could remove the `.to(['read'])` and allow all visitors to perform all actions on data or add permissions for signed-in users or users who belong to user groups such as `Admin`. You can learn more about all options for authorization in the [Customize your auth rules](/[platform]/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/) section of the docs.
</Callout>

<b>Step 2:</b> Remove public access by deleting the `allow.publicApiKey().to(['read'])` authorization rule. Your authorization rule will look like the code below:

```js title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// ...

.authorization(allow => [allow.owner()]),

// ...
```

Below the schema declaration, you will see the `defineData` function, which receives our schema and authorization configuration as arguments. The default configuration is for an `apiKey` to enable public access.

<b>Step 3:</b> Update the `defaultAuthorizationMode` to `userPool` so that the default is to use user authentication.

```ts title="amplify/data/resource.ts"
// ...

export const data = defineData({
  schema,
  authorizationModes: {
    defaultAuthorizationMode: 'userPool'
  }
});
```


### Add authentication

Now let's work on our authentication configuration. Similar to the `data/resource.ts` we just worked on, the `auth/resource.ts` file has code to define our authentication configuration. In this case, we are setting the authentication method to log in with email.

<Accordion title="See the complete amplify/auth/resources.ts">
```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

/**
 * Define and configure your auth resource
 * When used alongside data, it is automatically configured as an auth provider for data
 * @see https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/build-a-backend/auth
 */
export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
    email: true,
    // add social providers
    externalProviders: {
      /**
       * first, create your secrets using `amplify sandbox secret`
       * then, import `secret` from `@aws-amplify/backend`
       * @see https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/deploy-and-host/sandbox-environments/features/#setting-secrets
       */
      // loginWithAmazon: {
      //   clientId: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_ID'),
      //   clientSecret: secret('LOGINWITHAMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'),
      // }
    }
  },
  /**
   * enable multifactor authentication
   * @see https://docs.amplify.aws/gen2/build-a-backend/auth/manage-mfa
   */
  // multifactor: {
  //   mode: 'OPTIONAL',
  //   sms: {
  //     smsMessage: (code) => `Your verification code is ${code}`,
  //   },
  // },
  userAttributes: {
    /** request additional attributes for your app's users */
    // profilePicture: {
    //   mutable: true,
    //   required: false,
    // },
  }
});
```
</Accordion>

Let's customize the subject of the verification email sent to users after they sign up for our app. There is only one step to complete.

Open `amplify/auth/resource.ts` and update it to add a subject line by defining an object with email authentication properties referencing the code below:

```ts title="amplify/auth/resource.ts"
// amplify/auth/resource.ts
import { defineAuth } from '@aws-amplify/backend';

export const auth = defineAuth({
  loginWith: {
// highlight-start
   email: {
     verificationEmailSubject: 'Welcome! Verify your email!'
   },
// highlight-end
  }
});
```


<Callout info>The Data and Auth resource files are imported into the `amplify/backend.ts` file which serves as the entry point to the Amplify backend for all resources used in this app. It is shown below, but there are no modifications needed to complete this quickstart.</Callout>

```ts title="amplify/backend.ts"
import { defineBackend } from '@aws-amplify/backend';
import { auth } from './auth/resource';
import { data } from './data/resource';

defineBackend({
  auth,
  data
});
```
