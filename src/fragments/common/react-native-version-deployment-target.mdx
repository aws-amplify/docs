<Accordion title="Instructions for React Native version 0.72 and below">

  `@aws-amplify/react-native` requires a minimum iOS deployment target of `13.0` if you are using `react-native` version less than or equal to `0.72`. Open the _Podfile_ located in the _ios_ directory and update the `target` value:

  ```diff
   - platform :ios, min_ios_version_supported
   + platform :ios, 13.0
   ```
