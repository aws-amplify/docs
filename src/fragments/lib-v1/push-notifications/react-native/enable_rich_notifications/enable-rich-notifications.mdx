Amplify currently supports adding images to your notifications, but there are some additional steps required.

## Create a Notification Service Extension

1. Open `<your-app-name>.xcworkspace` located inside the `/ios` folder of your application project with Xcode.

2. In the Xcode project, select **File > New > Target...**

3. Select **Notification Service Extension > Next**.

4. Enter a name for your service extension (e.g. MyNotificationServiceExtension) and select **Finish**.

## Provide the extension with the Amplify service class

1. Open `Podfile` located inside the `/ios` folder of your application project with a text editor.

2. Add `AmplifyUtilsNotifications` to the extension you created above.

import addNotificationsPod from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/push-notifications/react-native/enable_rich_notifications/add-notifications-pod.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'react-native': addNotificationsPod }} />

4. Open `<your-app-name>.xcworkspace` located inside the `/ios` folder of your application project with Xcode.

5. Find your extension folder in the Project navigator pane and select the **Info** Property List.
