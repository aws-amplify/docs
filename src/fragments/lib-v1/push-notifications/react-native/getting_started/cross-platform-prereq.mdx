<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="iOS">

An application targeting at least iOS 13.0, using Xcode 14.1 or later.

import apnsPreReq from '/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/getting_started/apns-pre-req.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: apnsPreReq, 'react-native': apnsPreReq }} />

### Set Entitlements

Using Amplify Push Notifications with APNs requires the following capabilities:

- Push Notifications
- Background Processing -> Remote Notifications

To add these capabilities:

import iosSetEntitlements from '/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/getting_started/ios-set-entitlements.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: iosSetEntitlements, 'react-native': iosSetEntitlements }} />

</Block>
<Block name="Android">

An application targeting at least Android SDK API level 24.

import fcmPreReq from '/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/android/getting_started/fcm-pre-req.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: fcmPreReq, 'react-native': fcmPreReq }} />

### Applying the Google services plugin

The Firebase documentation directs you to add the Google services plugin to your app `build.gradle` using the [Gradle plugins DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:plugins_block). However, we recommend you continue to use the [Legacy Plugin Application](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/plugins.html#sec:old_plugin_application) instead:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```

If you prefer using the plugins DSL, you should add the `plugins` block to the very top of the file or you may experience issues when building your app for Android.
