In your project directory, you should first install the necessary dependencies for using Amplify Push Notifications.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@^5 @aws-amplify/rtn-push-notification@~1.1.x amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill
```

<Callout>

    Please note that v5 is compatible only with @aws-amplify/rtn-push-notification version 1.1.x

</Callout>

You will also need to add the crypto.getRandomValues and URL polyfills to your application's entry point file (in most React Native apps this will be the top level `index.js`).

```js
// Example index.js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
...
```
