You can use `onNotification`, `onRegister` and `onNotificationOpened` event handlers to work with push notifications in your app:

```javascript
// get the notification data when notification is received
PushNotification.onNotification((notification) => {
  // Note that the notification object structure is different from Android and IOS
  console.log('in app notification', notification);

  // required on iOS only (see fetchCompletionHandler docs: https://github.com/react-native-community/push-notification-ios#finish)
  notification.finish(PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult.NoData);
});

// get the registration token
// This will only be triggered when the token is generated or updated.
PushNotification.onRegister((token) => {
  console.log('in app registration', token);
});

// get the notification data when notification is opened
PushNotification.onNotificationOpened((notification) => {
    console.log('the notification is opened', notification);
});
```

<Callout>

The `onRegister` handler will only be triggered once when the token is generated or updated by the push provider i.e. Apple/Google (and when the app opened the first time). 

</Callout>

If you have configured your application not to automatically request iOS push notification permissions, you can use the `requestIOSPermissions` method to request them explicitly:

```javascript
// request iOS push notification permissions
PushNotification.requestIOSPermissions();

// request a subset of iOS push notification permissions
PushNotification.requestIOSPermissions({
  alert: true,
  badge: true,
  sound: false,
});
```
