Expand **Gradle Scripts**, open **build.gradle (Module :app)**. You will already have configured Amplify by following the steps in the [Project Setup walkthrough](/[platform]/prev/start/project-setup/create-application/).

Add Predictions by adding these libraries into the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Add these lines in `dependencies`
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-predictions:ANDROID_V1_VERSION'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:ANDROID_V1_VERSION'
}
```

`aws-auth-cognito` provides authentication for the backend services used by `aws-predictions`.
