## Set up the backend

If you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the *default configuration*).

Run `amplify add predictions` and select **Convert**. Then use the following answers:

```console
? What would you like to convert? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Convert text into a different language 
  Convert text to speech 
  Convert speech to text 
  Learn More 

? Who should have access? Auth and Guest users
```

Now run `amplify push` which will generate your `aws-exports.js` and create resources in the cloud. You can now either add this to your backend or skip and add more features to your app.

## Working with the API

Translate text from one source language to a destination language.

```javascript
Predictions.convert({
  translateText: {
    source: {
      text: textToTranslate,
      // language : "es" // defaults configured on aws-exports.js
      // supported languages https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/how-it-works.html#how-it-works-language-codes
    },
    // targetLanguage: "en"
  }
})
.then(result => console.log({ result }))
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```
