## Set up the backend

IIf you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the _default configuration_).

Run `amplify add predictions` and select **Convert**. Then use the following answers:

```console
? What would you like to convert? (Use arrow keys)
  Translate text into a different language
  Generate speech audio from text
> Transcribe text from audio

? Who should have access? Auth and Guest users
```

Now run `amplify push` which will generate your `aws-exports.js` and create resources in the cloud. You can now either add this to your backend or skip and add more features to your app.

Services used: Amazon Transcribe

## Working with the API

You can transcribe a PCM Audio byte buffer to Text, such as a recording from microphone.

```javascript
Predictions.convert({
  transcription: {
    source: {
      bytes
    }
    // language: "en-US",
  }
})
.then(({ transcription: { fullText } }) => console.log({ fullText }))
.catch((err) => console.log({ err }));
```

To view the complete list of all the supported languages and language specific features refer to [the supported languages list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/supported-languages.html). The language data input type has to support streaming for it to work with Amplify Predictions.
