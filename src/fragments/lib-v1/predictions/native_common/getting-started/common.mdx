The Predictions category enables you to integrate machine learning into your application without any prior machine learning experience. It supports translating text from one language to another, converting text to speech, text recognition from an image, entities recognition, labeling real world objects, interpretation of text, and uploading images for automatic training. This functionality is powered by AWS services including: [Amazon Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is-transcribe.html), [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html), [Amazon Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/what-is.html), and [Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html).

import ios0 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/ios/getting-started/10_coreml.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios0 }} />

## Goal

To setup and configure your application with Amplify Predictions and go through a simple example of translating text.

## Prerequisites

import ios1 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/ios/getting-started/20_preReq.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios1 }} />

import android2 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/android/getting-started/20_preReq.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ android: android2 }} />

## Provision Backend Services

To use the predictions category you will need to setup the auth backend resources. To provision auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add predictions
```

Enter the following when prompted:

```console
? Please select from one of the categories below
    `Convert`
? You need to add auth (Amazon Cognito) to your project in order to add storage for user files. Do you want to add auth now? (Y/n)
    `Y`
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Email`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? What would you like to convert?
    `Translate text into a different language`
? Provide a friendly name for your resource
    `transTextSample`
? What is the source language?
    `English`
? What is the target language?
    `Italian`
? Who should have access?
    ` Auth and Guest users`
```

Note that the languages selected during this stage will be the default language your app will translate to/from. These source and target languages can be overridden when you write the code in your application.

To push your change to the cloud, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` will be updated to reference the newly provisioned backend resources.

## Install Amplify Libraries

import ios3 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/ios/getting-started/30_installLib.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios3 }} />

import android4 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/android/getting-started/30_installLib.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ android: android4 }} />

## Initialize Amplify Predictions

import ios5 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/ios/getting-started/40_init.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios5 }} />

import android6 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/android/getting-started/40_init.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ android: android6 }} />

## Translating text

To translate text from one language to another, specify the text you want translated, a source language, and a target language. The source and target language parameters will override any choice you made while adding this resource using the Amplify CLI.

import ios7 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/ios/getting-started/50_translate.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ swift: ios7 }} />

import android8 from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/predictions/android/getting-started/50_translate.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ android: android8 }} />

As a result of executing this code, you will see the following printed to your console:

```console
Me gusta comer espaguetis
```

## Next steps
