Amplify for Flutter is distributed via [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/amplify_flutter).

1. From your project root directory, find and modify `pubspec.yaml` and add required Amplify plugins to the project dependencies. E.g.

import flutter0 from "/src/fragments/lib-v1/project-setup/flutter/create-application/60_dependencies.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter0}} />

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command. Depending on your development environment, you may perform this step via your IDE (or it may even be performed for you automatically).

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
