To start provisioning resources in the backend, change directories to your project directory and run `amplify init`:

```bash
# Make sure you have Amplify CLI v4.28 and above for Flutter support
amplify init
```

Amplify CLI then will suggest you an auto-generated options for you to speed up the process:

```console
Project information
| Name: yourprojectname
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: flutter
| Configuration file location: ./lib/

? Initialize the project with the above configuration?
```

If any of the following does not work for you, you can say no to the question that is prompted.

After that, Amplify CLI will take you through the installation process. Enter the following when prompted:

```console
? Enter a name for the environment
    `dev`
? Choose your default editor:
    `IntelliJ IDEA`
? Choose the type of app that you're building:
    'flutter'
? Where do you want to store your configuration file?
    ./lib/
```

After the project information is filled, you will be prompted to select the AWS profile for you to host your information.

```console
? Select the authentication method you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
❯ AWS profile
  AWS access keys

# This is the profile you created with the `amplify configure` command in the introduction step.
Please choose the profile you want to use (Use arrow keys)
> default
```
> Where possible, the CLI will infer the proper configuration based on the type of project Amplify is being initialized in. In this case, it knew you are using a Flutter app, source, distribution, build, and start options.


Upon successfully running `amplify init`, you will see a configuration file created in `./lib/` called `amplifyconfiguration.dart`.

This file will be bundled into your application so that the Amplify libraries know how to reach your provisioned backend resources at runtime.
