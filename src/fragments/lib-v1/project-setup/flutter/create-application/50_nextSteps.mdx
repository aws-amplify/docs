Congratulations!  You've created a skeleton app and are ready to start adding Amplify categories to your application.  The following are some categories that you can start to build into your application:

* [Analytics](/lib-v1/analytics/getting-started) - for logging metrics and understanding your users
* [API (GraphQL)](/lib-v1/graphqlapi/getting-started) - for adding a GraphQL endpoint to your app
* [API (REST)](/lib-v1/restapi/getting-started) - for adding a REST endpoint to your app
* [Authentication](/lib-v1/auth/getting-started) - for managing your users
* [DataStore](/lib-v1/datastore/getting-started) - for making it easier to program for a distributed data store for offline and online scenarios
* [Storage](/lib-v1/storage/getting-started) - store complex objects like pictures and videos to the cloud.
