## DELETE requests

  ```dart
Future<void> deleteTodo() async {
  try {
    final restOperation = Amplify.API.delete('todo/1');
    final response = await restOperation.response;
    print('DELETE call succeeded: ${response.decodeBody()}');
  } on ApiException catch (e) {
    print('DELETE call failed: $e');
  }
}
  ```
