Add the Auth and Analytics plugin, along with any other plugins you may have added as described in the **Project Setup** section;

```dart
Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {

  // Add Pinpoint and Cognito Plugins, or any other plugins you want to use
  final analyticsPlugin = AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint();
  final authPlugin = AmplifyAuthCognito();
  await Amplify.addPlugins([authPlugin, analyticsPlugin]);
  ...
}
```

Make sure that the amplifyconfiguration.dart file generated in the project setup is included and sent to Amplify.configure:

```dart
import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

...
  Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
    ...
    // Once Plugins are added, configure Amplify
    // Note: Amplify can only be configured once.
    try {
      await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
    } on AmplifyAlreadyConfiguredException {
      safePrint("Tried to reconfigure Amplify; this can occur when your app restarts on Android.");
    }
  }
...
```

Your class will look like this:

```dart
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';
import 'package:amplify_analytics_pinpoint/amplify_analytics_pinpoint.dart';
import 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';

import 'amplifyconfiguration.dart';

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
    @override
    void initState() {
        super.initState();
        _configureAmplify();
    }

    Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {

      // Add any Amplify plugins you want to use
      final analyticsPlugin = AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint();
      final authPlugin = AmplifyAuthCognito();
      // You can use addPlugin if you are going to be adding only one plugin
      // await Amplify.addPlugin(authPlugin);
      await Amplify.addPlugins([authPlugin, analyticsPlugin]);

      // Once Plugins are added, configure Amplify
      // Note: Amplify can only be configured once.
      try {
        await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
      } on AmplifyAlreadyConfiguredException {
        safePrint("Tried to reconfigure Amplify; this can occur when your app restarts on Android.");
      }
    }
}
```
