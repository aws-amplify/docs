## Record Event

The Amplify Analytics plugin provides a simple interface to record custom events within your app. The plugin handles retry logic in the event the device loses network connectivity, and automatically batches requests to reduce network bandwidth.

```swift
func recordEvents() {
    let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
        "eventPropertyStringKey": "eventPropertyStringValue",
        "eventPropertyIntKey": 123,
        "eventPropertyDoubleKey": 12.34,
        "eventPropertyBoolKey": true
    ]
    let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(name: "eventName", properties: properties)
    Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
}
```

## Flush Events

Events have default configuration to flush out to the network every 60 seconds. If you would like to change this, update `amplifyconfiguration.json` with the value you would like for `autoFlushEventsInterval` like so:

```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "analytics": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin": {
                "pinpointAnalytics": {
                    "appId": "AppID",
                    "region": "Region",
                    "autoFlushEventsInterval": 60
                },
                "pinpointTargeting": {
                    "region": "Region"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: If you set `autoFlushEventsInterval` to 0, you are responsible for calling `Amplify.Analytics.flushEvents()` to submit the recorded events to the backend.

## Authentication events
Indicate how frequently users authenticate with your application.

On the **Analytics** page, the **Users** tab displays charts for **Sign-ins, Sign-ups, and Authentication failures**.

To learn how frequently users authenticate with your app, update your application code so that Pinpoint receives the following standard event types for authentication:

 - `_userauth.sign_in`
 - `_userauth.sign_up`
 - `_userauth.auth_fail`

You can report authentication events by doing either of the following:

- Managing user sign-up and sign-in with Amazon Cognito user pools.

  Cognito user pools are user directories that make it easier to add sign-up and sign-in to your app. As users authenticate with your app, Cognito reports authentication events to Pinpoint. For more information, see [Using Amazon Pinpoint Analytics with Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-pinpoint-integration.html) in the _Amazon Cognito Developer Guide_. Also update **amplifyconfiguration.json** by adding the `PinpointAppId` key under `CognitoUserPool`.
  
  ```json
  "CognitoUserPool": {
      "Default": {
          "PoolId": "<poolid>",
          "AppClientId": "<appclientid>",
          "Region": "<region>",
          "PinpointAppId": "<pinpointappid>"
     }
  }
  ```

- Manually recording events using the `record(event:)` API.

  If you don't want to use Cognito user pools, you can use the Pinpoint client to record and submit authentication events, as shown in the following examples. In these examples, the event type is set to `_userauth.sign_in`, but you can substitute any authentication event type.

  ```swift
  func sendUserSignInEvent() {
      let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(
          name: "_userauth.sign_in"
      )
      Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
  }
  ```

## Global Properties

You can register properties which will be used across all `Amplify.Analytics.record(event:)` calls.

```swift
let globalProperties: AnalyticsProperties = ["globalPropertyKey": "value"]
Amplify.Analytics.registerGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

To unregister global properties call `Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()`:

```swift
// when called with no arguments, it unregisters all global properties
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()

// or you can specify properties to unregister
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties(["globalPropertyKey1", "globalPropertyKey2"])
```
