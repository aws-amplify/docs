## Record Event

The Amplify Analytics plugin provides a simple interface to record custom events within your app. The plugin handles retry logic in the event the device looses network connectivity, and automatically batches requests to reduce network bandwidth.

```swift
func recordEvents() {
    let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
        "eventPropertyStringKey": "eventPropertyStringValue",
        "eventPropertyIntKey": 123,
        "eventPropertyDoubleKey": 12.34,
        "eventPropertyBoolKey": true
    ]
    let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(name: "eventName", properties: properties)
    Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
}
```

## Flush Events

Events have default configuration to flush out to the network every 60 seconds. If you would like to change this, update `amplifyconfiguration.json` with the value you would like for `autoFlushEventsInterval` like so:

```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "analytics": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin": {
                "pinpointAnalytics": {
                    "appId": "AppID",
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "pinpointTargeting": {
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "autoFlushEventsInterval": 60
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: If you set `autoFlushEventsInterval` to 0, you are responsible for calling `Amplify.Analytics.flushEvents()` to submit the recorded events to the backend.

## Global Properties

You can register properties which will be used across all `Amplify.Analytics.record(event:)` calls.

```swift
let globalProperties: AnalyticsProperties = ["globalPropertyKey": "value"]
Amplify.Analytics.registerGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

To unregister global properties call `Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()`:

```swift
// when called with no arguments, it unregisters all global properties
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()

// or you can specify properties to unregister
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties(["globalPropertyKey1", "globalPropertyKey2"])
```

## Disable Analytics

Analytics are sent to the backend automatically (i.e. it's enabled by default). To disable it call:

```swift
Amplify.Analytics.disable()
```

## Enable Analytics

To re-enable it call:

```swift
Amplify.Analytics.enable()
```
