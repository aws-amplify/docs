## Record Event

The Amplify Analytics plugin provides a simple interface to record custom events within your app. The plugin handles retry logic in the event the device loses network connectivity, and automatically batches requests to reduce network bandwidth.

```swift
func recordEvents() {
    let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
        "eventPropertyStringKey": "eventPropertyStringValue",
        "eventPropertyIntKey": 123,
        "eventPropertyDoubleKey": 12.34,
        "eventPropertyBoolKey": true
    ]
    let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(name: "eventName", properties: properties)
    Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
}
```

<Callout>

The AWS Pinpoint event count updates in minutes after recording your event.

However, it can take upwards of 30 minutes for the event to display in the Filter section, and for its custom attributes to appear in Pinpoint.

Security Notice: Amplify Analytics temporarily stores event data locally in an unencrypted format before sending it to Pinpoint. 

To protect your sensitive information, please do not include any passwords, API keys, or other confidential information in your analytic events.

## Flush Events

Events have default configuration to flush out to the network every 60 seconds. If you would like to change this, update `amplifyconfiguration.json` with the value you would like for `autoFlushEventsInterval` like so:

```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "analytics": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin": {
                "pinpointAnalytics": {
                    "appId": "AppID",
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "pinpointTargeting": {
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "autoFlushEventsInterval": 60
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**: If you set `autoFlushEventsInterval` to 0, you are responsible for calling `Amplify.Analytics.flushEvents()` to submit the recorded events to the backend.

## Authentication events

import native_common from "/src/fragments/lib-v1/analytics/native_common/getting-started/auth-events.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: native_common}} />

  ```swift
  func sendUserSignInEvent() {
      let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(
          name: "_userauth.sign_in"
      )
      Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
  }
  ```

## Global Properties

You can register properties which will be used across all `Amplify.Analytics.record(event:)` calls.

```swift
let globalProperties: AnalyticsProperties = ["globalPropertyKey": "value"]
Amplify.Analytics.registerGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

To unregister global properties call `Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()`:

```swift
// when called with no arguments, it unregisters all global properties
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()

// or you can specify properties to unregister
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties(["globalPropertyKey1", "globalPropertyKey2"])
```
