This call sends information that you have specified about the user to Amazon Pinpoint. This could be an authenticated user. If the user is signed in through [Amplify.Auth.signIn](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/auth/enable-sign-in/), then you can retrieve the current user and use it with Analytics. You can also provide location information in `AnalyticsUserProfile.Location`.

```swift
func identifyUser() {

    guard let user = Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser() else {
        print("Could not get user, perhaps the user is not signed in")
        return
    }

    let location = AnalyticsUserProfile.Location(latitude: 47.606209,
                                                 longitude: -122.332069,
                                                 postalCode: "98122",
                                                 city: "Seattle",
                                                 region: "WA",
                                                 country: "USA")

    let properties: AnalyticsProperties = ["phoneNumber": "+11234567890", "age": 25]

    let userProfile = AnalyticsUserProfile(name: username,
                                           email: "name@example.com",
                                           location: location,
                                           properties: properties)

    Amplify.Analytics.identifyUser(user.userId, withProfile: userProfile)

}
```
