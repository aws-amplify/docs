To install the Amplify Analytics and Authentication to your application, **add both "AmplifyPlugins/AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin" and "AmplifyPlugins/AWSCognitoAuthPlugin" to your `Podfile`** (Because IAM credential is required to access AWS Pinpoint Service, `"AWSCognitoAuthPlugin"` also needs to be installed). Your `Podfile` should look similar to:

```bash
target 'MyAmplifyApp' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Amplify'
  pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin'
  pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSCognitoAuthPlugin'
end
```

To install, download and resolve these pods, **execute the command**:

```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

Now you can **open your project** by opening the `.xcworkspace` file using the following command:

```bash
xed .
```
