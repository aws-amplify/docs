Amazon Personalize can create recommendations by using event data, historical data, or a combination of both. The event data can then be used to create recommendations.

To record event data, you need the following:

* [A dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-dataset-group)
* [An event tracker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-get-tracker).

For more information, see [Record Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html).

### Installation and Configuration

Register the *AmazonPersonalizeProvider* with the Analytics category:
You need the tracking ID of your event tracker. For more information, see [Get a Tracking ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-get-tracker).

```javascript
import { Analytics, AmazonPersonalizeProvider } from 'aws-amplify';
Analytics.addPluggable(new AmazonPersonalizeProvider());
```

Configure Amazon Personalize:

```javascript
// Configure the plugin after adding it to the Analytics module
Analytics.configure({
    AmazonPersonalize: {

        // REQUIRED - The trackingId to track the events
        trackingId: '<TRACKING_ID>',

        // OPTIONAL -  Amazon Personalize service region
        region: 'XX-XXXX-X',

        // OPTIONAL - The number of events to be deleted from the buffer when flushed.
        flushSize: 10,

        // OPTIONAL - The interval in milliseconds to perform a buffer check and flush if necessary.
        flushInterval: 5000, // 5s
    }
});
```
### Working with the API

You can use the `Identify` event type to track a user identity. This lets you connect a user to their actions and record traits about them. To identify a user, specify a unique identifier for the userId property.
 Consider the following user interactions when choosing when and how often to call record with the  Identify eventType:

* After a user registers.
* After a user logs in.
* When a user updates their information (For example, changing or adding a new address).
* Upon loading any pages that are accessible by a logged-in user (optional).

```javascript
Analytics.record({
        eventType: "Identify",
        properties: {
           "userId": "<USER_ID>"
        }
    }, 'AmazonPersonalize');
```
You can send events to Amazon personalize by calling the `record` operation. If you already use `Identify` to track end-user data, you can skip the userId, the SDK will fetch the userId based on current browser session.
For information about the properties field, see [Put Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html).

```javascript
Analytics.record({
        eventType: "<EVENT_TYPE>",
        userId: "<USER_ID>", (optional)
        properties: {
          "itemId": "<ITEM_ID>",
          "eventValue": "<EVENT_VALUE>"}
    },
    "AmazonPersonalize");
```
You can track iframe and HTML5 media types by using the MediaAutoTrack event type. MediaAutoTrack tracks all media events of the media DOM element that you bind to. `MediaAutoTracker` will automatically track *Play*, *Pause*, *Ended*, *TimeWatched*, and *Resume* in `eventType`. The duration of the event compared to the total length of the media is stored as a percentage value in `eventValue`.

```javascript
Analytics.record({
    eventType: "MediaAutoTrack",
    userId: "<USER_ID>", (optional)
    properties: {
        "domElementId": "MEDIA DOM ELEMENT ID",
        "itemId": "<ITEM_ID>"
    }
}, "AmazonPersonalize");
```
