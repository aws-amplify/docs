This API sends information about the current user to Amazon Pinpoint.

Additional information such as the user's name, email, location, and device can be included by specifying the `UserProfile`. Custom attributes can also be included by setting `UserProfile.attributes`.

You can provide `name`, `email` and `plan`, as well as location information with `AnalyticsUserProfile.Location`. You can also send additional custom attributes using  `AnalyticsProperties`.

If the user was signed in through [signIn](/lib/auth/signin) you can retrieve the current user's ID as shown below:

```js
import { identifyUser } from "aws-amplify/analytics";
import { getCurrentUser } from "aws-amplify/auth";

const location = {
    latitude: 47.606209,
    longitude: -122.332069,
    postalCode: "98122",
    city: "Seattle",
    region: "WA",
    country: "USA"
};

const attributes = {
    name: "username",
    email: "name@example.com",
    plan: "plan",
    "phoneNumber": "+11234567890",
    "age": 25
}

let userProfile = {
    name: "username",
    email: "name@example.com",
    plan: "plan",
    location: location,
    properties: properties
}

async function sendUserData() {
    const user = await getCurrentUser(); 

    identifyUser({
        userId: user.userId,
        userProfile: userProfile
    });
}
```
