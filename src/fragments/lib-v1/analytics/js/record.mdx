## Recording Custom Events

To record custom events call the `record` API where required. This could be in a component or elsewhere in your application.

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({ 
  event: {
    name: 'albumVisit'
  }
});
```

## Record a Custom Event with Attributes

The `record` API lets you add additional attributes to an event. For example, to record _artist_ information with an _albumVisit_ event:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({
  event: {
    name: 'albumVisit',
    attributes: { genre: '', artist: '' }
  }
});
```

Recorded events will be buffered and periodically sent to Pinpoint.

## Record Engagement Metrics

Metrics can also be added to an event:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({
  event: {
    name: 'albumVisit',
    metrics: { minutesListened: 30 }
  }
});
```

Metric values must be a `Number` type such as a float or integer.

The AWS Pinpoint event count updates in minutes after recording your event.

However, it can take upwards of 30 minutes for the event to display in the Filter section, and for its custom attributes to appear in Pinpoint.
