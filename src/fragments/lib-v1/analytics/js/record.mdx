## Recording Custom Events

To record custom events call the `record` method:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({ name: 'albumVisit' });
```

## Record a Custom Event with Attributes

The `record` method lets you add additional attributes to an event. For example, to record _artist_ information with an _albumVisit_ event:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({
  name: 'albumVisit',
  // Attribute values must be strings
  attributes: { genre: '', artist: '' }
});
```

## Record Engagement Metrics

Data can also be added to an event:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

record({
  name: 'albumVisit',
  attributes: {},
  metrics: { minutesListened: 30 }
});
```

Metric values must be a `Number` type such as a float or integer.

The AWS Pinpoint event count updates in minutes after recording your event.

However, it can take upwards of 30 minutes for the event to display in the Filter section, and for its custom attributes to appear in Pinpoint.
