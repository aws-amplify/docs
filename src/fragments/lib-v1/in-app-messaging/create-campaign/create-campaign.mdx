A campaign is a messaging initiative that engages a specific audience [segment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/segments.html). A campaign sends tailored messages according to a schedule that you define. You can use the AWS console to create a campaign that sends messages through any single channel that is supported by Amazon Pinpoint: Mobile Push, In-App, Email, SMS or Custom channels. [Learn how to create a campaign using Amazon Pinpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/userguide/campaigns.html) to continue integrating in-app messages in your app with Amplify.
