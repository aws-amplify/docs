If you need functionality in the AWSLocation framework used by the Amplify Geo category that isn't available, we provide an escape hatch so you can reference it directly.

Note: If you provisioned your Geo resources via Amplify CLI, then the IAM policy will be specifically scoped to only allow actions required by the library.
Please [adjust your authorization permissions](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/existing-resources/) accordingly for your escape hatch use-cases.

<Block name="Swift Package Manager">

```swift
import AWSLocationXCF
```
</Block>

<Block name="CocoaPods">

```swift
import AWSLocation
```

</Block>

Then retrieve the escape hatch and call methods on `AWSLocation` directly:


```swift
do {
    // Retrieve AWSLocationGeoPlugin
    let plugin = try Amplify.Geo.getPlugin(for: "awsLocationGeoPlugin")
    guard let locationPlugin = plugin as? AWSLocationGeoPlugin else {
        return
    }

    // Retrieve reference to AWSLocation
    let awsLocation = locationPlugin.getEscapeHatch()

    // Make Request
    let request = AWSLocationListMapsRequest()!
    request.maxResults = 5
    awsLocation.listMaps(request) { response, error in
        // handle response ...
    }
} catch {
    print("Error occurred while fetching the escape hatch \(error)")
}
```
