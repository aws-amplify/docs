> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/[platform]/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/)

To start provisioning Geo resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

```sh
amplify add geo
```

The CLI will prompt configuration options for the Geo category for what type of capability you want to add and default or advanced settings. The `add` command automatically creates the backend configuration. Once all your configuration is complete run the following:

```sh
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` should be updated to reference provisioned backend geo resources. Note that this file should already be a part of your project if you followed the Project setup walkthrough.
