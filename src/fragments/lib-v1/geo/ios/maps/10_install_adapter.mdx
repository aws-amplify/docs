First, ensure you've provisioned an Amazon Location Service Map resource and configured your app using the instructions in either [Configure Maps](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/maps) or [Use existing resources](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/existing-resources/) guide.

**Troubleshooting:** If your project already imports Amplify through CocoaPods, you may encounter build errors after adding the Amplify-MapLibre adapter. If this occurs, switching to SPM will resolve the issue.

Amplify-MapLibre is an open source adapter that enables the popular MapLibre SDK to work seamlessly with Amplify Geo.

1. To install the Amplify-MapLibre adapter to your application, open your project in Xcode and select **File > Add Packages...**

1. Enter the amplify-ios-maplibre GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios-maplibre`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**. Wait for the result to load. You'll see the repository rules for which version of amplify-ios-mapLibre you want Swift Package Manager to install.

1. Choose the dependency rule **Up to Next Major Version**, as it will use the latest compatible version of the dependency, then click **Add Package**.

1. Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. If you want to use the SwiftUI user interface components provided by the adapter, select both **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter** and **AmplifyMapLibreUI**. If you only want to enable Amplify Geo to work directly with MapLibre and do not wish use use the provided SwiftUI views, you can just select **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter**. After you select the libraries, click **Add Package**.

You can always go back and modify which SPM packages are included in your project by opening the Swift Packages tab for your project (`Project file > Project > Package Dependencies`)
