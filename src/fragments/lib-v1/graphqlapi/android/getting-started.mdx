> ### Prerequisites
>
> - An [Android project](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project) targeting Android API level 21 (Android 5.0) or above
> - [Install and configure](/[platform]/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/) the Amplify CLI

## GraphQL API with Amplify

The Amplify API category provides a solution for making HTTP requests to REST and GraphQL endpoints. For GraphQL, it supports [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/).

## Create GraphQL API service

Run the following command in your project's root folder:

```bash
amplify add api
```

```console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: `GraphQL`
? Provide API name: `apiName`
? Choose the default authorization type for the API: `API key`
? Enter a description for the API key:
? After how many days from now the API key should expire (1-365): `30`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings for the GraphQL API `No, I am done.`
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? `No`
? Choose a schema template: `One-to-many relationship (e.g., "Blogs" with "Posts" and "Comments")`
? Do you want to edit the schema now? `No`
```

This will create the following schema for us to get started with:

```graphql
type Blog @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post] @hasMany
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  blog: Blog @hasOne
  comments: [Comment] @hasMany
}

type Comment @model {
  id: ID!
  content: String
  post: Post @belongsTo
}
```

To deploy the API, you can use the Amplify `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

```console
? Are you sure you want to continue? `Yes`
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API `No`
```

When your backend is successfully provisioned, there should be two new generated files : `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` in your `app/src/main/res/raw` directory.

To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

Generate the Java models to easily perform operations on your schema with the following command:

```console
$ amplify codegen models

The following types do not have '@auth' enabled. Consider using @auth with @model
     - Blog
     - Post
     - Comment
Learn more about [@auth here](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/).

GraphQL schema compiled successfully.
```

This will generate the Model files to be used with `Amplify.API` to query, mutate, and subscribe to your AppSync endpoint. After build completes, the model files will be generated under `app/src/main/java/com/amplifyframework.datastore.generated.model`.

Note: You will see import errors in these files until performing the next steps below.

## Configure your application

Open your **project** `build.gradle` and add `mavenCentral()` as a repository:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Next, add the following dependencies to your **app** `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:ANDROID_V1_VERSION'

  // Support for Java 8 features
  coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'
}
```

Also in your **app** `build.gradle`, add this piece of code to support the Java 8 features Amplify uses:

```groovy
android {
  compileOptions {
    // Support for Java 8 features
    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}
```

Sync the project with Maven and ensure it builds successfully.

## Initialize Amplify

Add the following imports at the top of your MainActivity and code at the bottom of the `onCreate` method (ideally this would go in your Application class but this works for getting started quickly):

```java
import com.amplifyframework.AmplifyException;
import com.amplifyframework.api.aws.AWSApiPlugin;
import com.amplifyframework.core.Amplify;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        try {
            Amplify.addPlugin(new AWSApiPlugin());
            Amplify.configure(getApplicationContext());
            Log.i("ApiQuickstart", "All set and ready to go!");
        } catch (AmplifyException exception) {
            Log.e("ApiQuickstart", exception.getMessage(), exception);
        }
    }
}
```

### Summary

Now you should be able to build and run your Android application and see "All set and ready to go!" in logcat.

In this example, you setup a GraphQL API using the Amplify CLI, autogenerated Java Model classes from the API schema, and integrated it into your Android application.
