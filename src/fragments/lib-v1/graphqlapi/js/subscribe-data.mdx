## Using Amplify GraphQL client

Subscriptions is a GraphQL feature allowing the server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens. You can enable real-time data integration in your app with a subscription.

```javascript
import { Amplify, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as subscriptions from './graphql/subscriptions';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const subscription = API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
  next: ({ provider, value }) => console.log({ provider, value }),
  error: (error) => console.warn(error)
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

When using **AWS AppSync** subscriptions, be sure that your AppSync configuration is at the root of the configuration object, instead of being under API:

```javascript
Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    identityPoolId: 'xxx',
    region: 'xxx',
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: 'xxx',
      path: 'xxx',
      secure: true
    }
  },
  aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_region: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_apiKey: 'xxxx'
});
```

### Subscription connection status updates

Now that your application is setup and using subscriptions, you may want to know when the subscription is finally established, or reflect to your users when the subscription isn't healthy. You can monitor the connection state for changes via Hub.

```typescript
import { CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE, ConnectionState } from '@aws-amplify/pubsub';
import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify';

Hub.listen('api', (data: any) => {
  const { payload } = data;
  if (payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE) {
    const connectionState = payload.data.connectionState as ConnectionState;
    console.log(connectionState);
  }
});
```

import jsConnectionStates from '/src/fragments/lib/pubsub/js/connection-states.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: jsConnectionStates }} />
