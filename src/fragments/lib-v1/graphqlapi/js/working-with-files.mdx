The Storage and GraphQL API categories can be used together to associate a file, such as an image or video, with a particular record. For example, you might create a `User` model with a profile picture, or a `Post` model with an associated image. With Amplify's GraphQL API and Storage categories, you can reference the file within the model itself to create an association.

To get started, run the following commands in an existing Amplify project:

```bash
# For Authenticator component:
npm i @aws-amplify/ui-react

# Select default configuration:
amplify add auth

# Select "Content", "Auth users only", full CRUD access,
# and default configuration:
amplify add storage

# Select default configuration
amplify add api
```

When prompted, use the following schema, which can also be found under `amplify/backend/api/[name of project]/schema.graphql`:

```graphql
type Song @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  coverArtKey: String # Set as optional to allow adding file after initial create
}
```

Save the schema and run `amplify push` to deploy the changes.

Next, at the root of your project, set _all_ access to `private` by configuring the Storage object globally. This will restrict file access to only the signed-in user.

```js
Storage.configure({ level: 'private' });
```

For the complete working example, including required imports, obtaining the file from the user, and React component state management, see the [Complete Example](#complete-example) below.

## Configuring authorization

Your application needs authorization credentials for reading and writing to both Storage and the GraphQL API, except in the case where all data and files are intended to be publicly accessible.

The Storage and API categories govern data access based on their own authorization patterns, meaning that it's necessary to configure appropriate auth roles for each individual category. Although both categories share the same access credentials set up through the Auth category, they work independently from one another. For instance, adding an `@auth` directive to the API schema does not guard against file access in the Storage category. Likewise, adding authorization rules to the Storage category does not guard against data access in the API category.

When you run `amplify add storage`, the CLI will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using a Cognito Identity Pool role. You will then have the option of adding CRUD (Create, Update, Read and Delete) based permissions as well, so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted limited permissions within these levels. **Even after adding this configuration via the CLI, all Storage access is still `public` by default.** To guard against accidental public access, the Storage access levels must either be configured on the Storage object globally, or set within individual function calls. This guide uses the former approach, setting all Storage access to `private` globally.

The ability to independently configure authorization rules for each category allows for more granular control over data access, and adds greater flexibility. For scenarios where authorization patterns must be mixed and matched, configure the access level on individual Storage function calls. For example, you may want to use `private` CRUD access on an individual Storage function call for files that should only be accessible by the owner (such as personal files), `protected` read access to allow all logged in users to view common files (such as images in a shared photo album), and `public` read access to allow all users to view a file (such as a public profile picture).

For more details on how to configure Storage authorization levels, see the [Storage documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/configure-access/). For more on configuring GraphQL API authorization, see the [API documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules/).

## Create a record with an associated file

First create a record via the GraphQL API, then upload the file to Storage, and finally add the association between the record and file. Use the following example with the GraphQL API and Storage categories to create a record and associate the file with the record.

<Callout>

The API record's `id` is prepended to the Storage file name to ensure uniqueness. If this is excluded, multiple API records could then be associated with the same file key unintentionally.

## Add or update a file for an associated record

To associate a file with a record, update the record with the key returned by the Storage upload. The following example uploads the file using Storage, updates the record with the file's key, then retrieves the signed URL to download the image. If an image is already associated with the record, this will update the record with the new image.

## Delete and remove files associated with API records

There are three common deletion workflows when working with Storage files and the GraphQL API:

1. Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record.
2. Remove the record association and delete the file.
3. Delete both file and record.

### Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record

The following example removes the file association from the record, but does not delete the file from S3, nor the record from the database.

## Working with multiple files

You may want to add multiple files to a single record, such as a user profile with multiple images. To do this, you can add a list of file keys to the record. The following example adds a list of file keys to a record:

### GraphQL schema to associate a data model with multiple files

When prompted after running `amplify add api` use the following schema, which can also be found under `amplify/backend/api/[name of project]/schema.graphql`:

```graphql
type PhotoAlbum @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  imageKeys: [String] #Set as optional to allow adding file(s) after initial create
}
```

CRUD operations when working with multiple files is the same as when working with a single file, with the exception that we are now working with a list of image keys, as opposed to a single image key.

### Create a record with multiple associated files

First create a record via the GraphQL API, then upload the files to Storage, and finally add the associations between the record and files.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
const photoAlbumDetails: CreatePhotoAlbumInput = {

  variables: { input: photoAlbumDetails }

const photoAlbum = response?.data?.createPhotoAlbum;

if (!photoAlbum) return;

// Upload all files to Storage:
const imageKeys = await Promise.all(
  Array.from(e.target.files).map(async (file) => {
    const result = await Storage.put(`${photoAlbum.id}-${file.name}`, file, {
      contentType: 'image/png' // contentType is optional
    });

    return result?.key;
  })
);

## Data consistency when working with records and files

The recommended access patterns in these docs attempt to remove deleted files, but favor leaving orphans over leaving records that point to non-existent files. This optimizes for read latency by ensuring clients _rarely_ attempt to fetch a non-existent file from Storage. However, any app that deletes files can inherently cause records _on-device_ to point to non-existent files.

One example is when we [create an API record, associate the Storage file with that record, and then retrieve the file's signed URL](#create-a-record-with-an-associated-file). "Device A" calls the GraphQL API to create `API_Record_1`, and then associates that record with `First_Photo`. Before "Device A" is about to retrieve the signed URL, "Device B" might query `API_Record_1`, delete `First_Photo`, and update the record accordingly. However, "Device A" is still using the old `API_Record_1`, which is now out-of-date. Even though the shared global state is correctly in sync at every stage, the individual device ("Device A") has an out-of-date record that points to a non-existent file. Similar issues can conceivably occur for updates. Depending on your app, some of these mismatches can be minimized _even more_ with [real-time data / GraphQL subscriptions](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/subscribe-data/).

It is important to understand when these mismatches can occur and to add meaningful error handling around these cases. This guide does not include exhaustive error handling, real-time subscriptions, re-querying of outdated records, or attempts to retry failed operations. However, these are all important considerations for a production-level application.
