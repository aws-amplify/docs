If the next step is `confirmSignInWithTOTPCode`, you should prompt the user to enter the TOTP code from their associated authenticator app during set up. The code is a six-digit number that changes every 30 seconds. The user must enter the code before the 30-second window expires.

After the user enters the code, your implementation must pass the value to Amplify Auth `confirmSignIn` API.

```dart
Future<void> _handleSignInResult(SignInResult result) async {
  switch (result.nextStep.signInStep) {
    // ···
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithTotpMfaCode:
      safePrint('Enter a one-time code from your registered authenticator app');
    // ···
  }
}

// Then, pass the TOTP code to `confirmSignIn`

Future<void> confirmTotpUser(String totpCode) async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Auth.confirmSignIn(
      confirmationValue: totpCode,
    );
    return _handleSignInResult(result);
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Error confirming TOTP code: ${e.message}');
  }
}
```
