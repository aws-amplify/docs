## Authentication with Amplify

There are 2 options to add authentication capabilities to your application:

- Option 1: Use Amplify Authenticator UI Library
- Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

## Option 1: Use Authenticator UI Library

The Amplify Authenticator UI library allows you to quickly create an authentication/registration flow within your app. The experience generated within your app will be determined by the `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file that is automatically generated for you after initializing your app, and adding auth or other categories.

Visit [https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/flutter/components/authenticator](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/flutter/components/authenticator) to get started.

## Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

Follow the instructions in [Sign In](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/auth/enable-sign-in/) to learn about how to integrate these authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.
