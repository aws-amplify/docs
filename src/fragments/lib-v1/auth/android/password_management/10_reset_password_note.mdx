Note that you must call confirmResetPassword in the same app session as you call resetPassword. If you close the app, you'll need to call resetPassword again.
As a result, for testing purposes, you'll at least need an input field where you can enter the code sent by the resetPassword api and feed it to confirmResetPassword.
