The following steps show how to enable MFA as "Optional" for users. In this mode, MFA must be enabled on a user-by-user basis, either through an Admin SDK 
(e.g. via a Lambda trigger as part of the sign-up process), or manually in the Cognito console.

If you'd like to make MFA required for users, you must first delete your auth resource by running `amplify remove auth`, then follow the **New Project** flow on this page.
