AWS Amplify Interactions category enables AI-powered chatbots in your web or mobile apps. You can use _Interactions_ to configure your backend chatbot provider and to integrate a chatbot UI into your app with just a single line of code.

## Interactions with AWS

AWS Amplify implements [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex) as the default chatbots service. Amazon Lex supports creating conversational bots with the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa.

## Create new chatbot

> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

Run the following command in your project's root folder:

```bash
amplify add interactions
```

<Callout>

Adding interactions from the CLI only allows you to create a Lex V1 bot. If you want to create a Lex V2 bot, you can do so following the [instructions here](#lex-v2-bot).

</Callout>

The CLI will lead you through the steps to specify the chatbot to be created.

You can choose to start from a sample chatbot or start from scratch. If you choose to start from scratch, the CLI will prompt you with a series of questions to set the intents and slots for the chatbot.

You are allowed to run the `amplify add interactions` command multiple times to add multiple chatbots into your project.

<Callout warning>
  The Interactions category utilizes the Authentication category behind the
  scenes to authorize your app to send analytics events.
</Callout>

The `add` command automatically creates a backend configuration locally. To update your backend in the cloud, run:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon successful execution of the push command, a configuration file called `aws-exports.js` will be copied to your configured source directory, for example `./src`.

> If your Interactions resources were created with Amplify CLI version 1.6.4 and below, you will need to manually update your project to avoid Node.js runtime issues with AWS Lambda. [Read more](/cli/function/configure-options)
