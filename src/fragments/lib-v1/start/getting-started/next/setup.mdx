## Create a New Next.js App

import versionRangeCallout from '/src/fragments/lib/ssr/nextjs/version-range-callout.mdx';

<Fragments
  fragments={{
    javascript: versionRangeCallout,
    angular: versionRangeCallout,
    nextjs: versionRangeCallout,
    react: versionRangeCallout,
    vue: versionRangeCallout
  }}

To set up the project, you will need to create a new Next.js app with the [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) tool. You'll then add Amplify and initialize a new project.

Run the following command and following the instructions to create a Next.js app.

```shellscript
npx create-next-app@">=13.5.0 <15.0.0" next-amplified
```

Then run the following command to enter the root of your Next.js app.

```shellscript
cd next-amplified
```

You can now run the app in development mode by using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Create a New Amplify Backend

Now that you have a running Next.js app, it's time to set up Amplify so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app.

<Callout warning>

To use Amplify JS V6 with the Next.js, please ensure the Amplify CLI version in your system is higher than `12.5.1`. You can check the CLI version by running `amplify --version`.

</Callout>

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app.

```console
? Enter a name for the project (nextamplified)
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: nextamplified
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as a GraphQL API and authentication. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources

As you add or remove categories and make updates to your backend configuration using the Amplify CLI, the configuration in `amplifyconfiguration.json` will update automatically.

## Install Amplify libraries

Install required dependencies to your Next.js app to start using Amplify.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@next @aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs@next
```

The `aws-amplify` package is the main library for working with Amplify in your apps. The `@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs` provides adapter functions to enable use of Amplify APIs on the server side of your Next.js app for use cases such as Server Side Rendering (SSR).

For details of using Amplify with in your Next.js app, see [use Amplify with Next.js](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/server-side-rendering/).
