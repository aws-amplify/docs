Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash
npx -p @angular/cli ng new amplify-app

? Would you like to add Angular routing? Y
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? (your preferred stylesheet provider)

cd amplify-app
```

Angular 6+ does not include shims for 'global' or 'process'.

<Block name="Angular 15">

First, create `src/polyfills.ts` and add the following:

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

Then, open your `angular.json` file, and add `src/polyfills.ts` to polyfills array(s) in your `angular.json`. These arrays are located in projects.`<project-name>.architect.<task-name>.options`.

```javascript
"polyfills": [
  "zone.js",
  "src/polyfills.ts"
],
```

And finally, make sure to add `src/polyfills` to files in your `tsconfig.app.json`:

```javascript
{
  "files": [
    "src/main.ts",
    "src/polyfills.ts"
  ],
}
```
</Block>

<Block name="Angular 6-14">

Add the following to your `src/polyfills.ts` file to recreate them: 

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```

</Block>

## Create a new Amplify backend

Now that you have a running Angular app, it's time to set up Amplify for this app so that you can create the necessary backend services needed to support the app. 

Open a new terminal. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
amplify init
```

When you initialize Amplify you'll be prompted for some information about the app.  For newer versions of Angular, you will have to change the Distribution Directory Path from `dist` to `dist/amplify-app` to match how Angular will build your project.

```console
? Enter a name for the project: amplifyapp
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: amplifyapp
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: angular
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: dist
| Build Command: npm run-script build
| Start Command: ng serve

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use: default
```

When you initialize a new Amplify project, a few things happen:

- It creates a top level directory called `amplify` that stores your backend definition. During the tutorial you'll add capabilities such as authentication, GraphQL API, storage, and set up authorization rules for the API. As you add features, the `amplify` folder will grow with infrastructure-as-code templates that define your backend stack. Infrastructure-as-code is a best practice way to create a replicable backend stack.
- It creates a file called `aws-exports.js` in the `src` directory that holds all the configuration for the services you create with Amplify. This is how the Amplify client is able to get the necessary information about your backend services.
- It modifies the `.gitignore` file, adding some generated files to the ignore list.
- A cloud project is created for you in the AWS Amplify Console that can be accessed by running `amplify console`. The Console provides a list of backend environments, deep links to provisioned resources per Amplify category, status of recent deployments, and instructions on how to promote, clone, pull, and delete backend resources.

## Install Amplify libraries

Inside the `amplify-app` directory, install the Amplify Angular library and run your app:

```bash
npm install --save aws-amplify@next

npm start
```

Angular CLI output warnings: if you see CommonJS or AMD dependencies optimization bailouts warnings using Angular 9+, you can use this [gist](https://gist.github.com/wlee221/6d98d96740bea6f53327b4db4a432616) to remove them. More details about these [here](https://angular.io/guide/build#configuring-commonjs-dependencies).

import ui_callout from '/src/fragments/lib-v1/v6/callout/ui.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'all': ui_callout }} />

### Strictly typing `aws-exports`

If you have TypeScript [strict mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) on and see the error

```
Could not find a declaration file for module './aws-exports'. 'aws-exports.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

Create a `aws-exports.d.ts` file on the same level as aws-exports with the following content:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile;
```
