If you are using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used with the Amplify Libraries by running:

```bash
amplify import storage
```

For more details, see how to [Use an existing S3 bucket or DynamoDB table](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/import/).

If you are not using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used by referencing it in your Amplify configuration file.

<Callout warning>
When you are not using Amplify CLI, adding existing Amazon S3 bucket to your application may require configuring bucket access permissions. e.g. Enabling read/write access to the cognito user pool that you are using with the Amplify Auth category.
</Callout>

```json
{
    "storage": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsS3StoragePlugin": {
                  "bucket": "[BUCKET NAME]",
                  "region": "[REGION]"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- **bucket**: Name of the bucket to use for storage
- **region**: AWS Region where the bucket is provisioned (e.g. *us-east-1*)

Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](/gen1/[platform]/prev/start/project-setup/create-application/#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
