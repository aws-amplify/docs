To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories, call `Amplify.addPlugin()` for each plugin or pass all the plugins in `Amplify.addPlugins()`. To complete initialization, call `Amplify.configure()`.

```dart
Future<void> _configureAmplify() async {
  // Add these lines, to include Auth and Storage plugins.
  final auth = AmplifyAuthCognito();
  final storage = AmplifyStorageS3();
  await Amplify.addPlugins([storage, auth]);
  try {
    await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
  } on Exception catch (e) {
    print(
        'Tried to configure Amplify and following error occurred: $e');
  }
}
```
