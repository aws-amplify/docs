You can move an existing file to a different folder location in your S3 bucket. The user initiating the move operation must have read and write permission on both the source file and destination file.

```dart
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';
Future<void> movePrivateFile({
  required String sourceKey,
  required String destinationKey,
}) async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Storage.move(
      source: StorageItemWithAccessLevel(
        storageItem: StorageItem(key: sourceKey),
        accessLevel: StorageAccessLevel.private,
      ),
      destination: StorageItemWithAccessLevel(
        storageItem: StorageItem(key: destinationKey),
        accessLevel: StorageAccessLevel.private,
      ),
    ).result;
    safePrint('Moved file to: ${result.movedItem.key}');
  } on StorageException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Something went wrong moving the file: ${e.message}');
    rethrow;
  }
}
```
