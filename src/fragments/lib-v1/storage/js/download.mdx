There are three ways of getting data that was previously uploaded:

## Generate a download URL

Get a presigned URL of a stored file and expiration of URL. You can specify [access `level`](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib-v1/storage/configureaccess/q/platform/js) of file

```typescript
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

const getUrlResult: {
	url: URL;
	expiresAt: Date;
} = await getUrl({
    key: filename,
    options: { accessLevel: 'private' | 'protected' | 'guest' , // defaults to `guest` 
    targetIdentityId?: string, // id of another user, if `level: protected`
    validateObjectExistence: false,  // defaults to false
    expiresIn: 20 // validity of the URL, in seconds. defaults to 900 (15 minutes) and maxes at 3600 (1 hour)
    },
});
```

`getUrl` returns a signed URL `string` to your file. You can use this to create a download link for users to click on. Note that this function **does not check if the file exists by default**. You can enable this check by setting `validateObjectExistence` to `true`.

> Note: Currently, the expiration time of the presigned url is dependent on the session and will max out at 1 hour.

```js
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

// get the signed URL string
const signedURL = getUrl({ key: filename }); // get key from list

// inside your template or JSX code. Note <a download> doesn't work here because it is not same origin
<a href={signedURL.url.toString()} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
  {fileName}
</a>;
```

### Check for existence of a file

You can check for the existence of a file in the storage category's `getUrl` API using the `validateObjectExistence` option. When this flag is enabled a `getUrl` call will return a pre-signed URL if the file exists and raise a `404` error if it does not. This allows you to check if an object exists during generating the presigned URL, which you can then use to download that object.

```typescript
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

// To check for existence of a file
await getUrl({
    key: filename,
    options: {
      validateObjectExistence: true,  // defaults to false
    },
});
```

### getUrl expiry

You can use `expiresIn` option to limit the availability of your URLs. This configuration returns the pre-signed URL that expires in 60 seconds:

```javascript
import { getUrl } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

await getUrl('filename.txt', { expiresIn: 60 });
```


## downloadData

Download a file to in-memory buffer.

```typescript
import { downloadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

// Download a file from s3 bucket
const { body, eTag } = await downloadData({ key, data: file, options: {
onProgress, // Optional progress callback.
} }).result;
```
### Get the text value of downloaded File
we can get  the value of file in any of the three 'blob' | 'json' | 'text' formats. Replaces the respective method to get respective value.

```typescript
import { downloadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

try {
	const downloadResult: { body: Pick<Body, 'blob' | 'json' | 'text'> } 
	= await downloadData({ key: filename }).result;
	if (downloadResult?.body?.text)
		downloadResult?.body
			?.text()
			.then((result) => console.log(result));
} catch (error) {
	console.log('Error : ', error)
}
```

To track the progress of your download, you can use `progressCallback`:

```typescript
import { downloadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

// Download a file from s3 bucket
const { body, eTag } = await downloadData(
  {
    key,
    data: file,
    options: {
      onProgress: (progress) {
        console.log(`Downloaded: ${progress.transferredBytes}/${progress.totalBytes}`);
      }
    }
  }
).result;
```
Cancel a task 

```typescript
import { downloadData } from 'aws-amplify/storage';

const downloadTask = downloadData({ key, data: file });
downloadTask.cancel();
try {
	await downloadTask.result;
} catch (error) {
	if(isCancelError(error)) {
   // Handle error thrown by task cancellation.
	}
}
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

Users can run into unexpected issues, so we are giving you advance notice in documentation with links to open issues - please vote for what you need, to help the team prioritize.

- `downloadData` is cached; if you have recently modified a file you may not get the latest version right away. You can pass in `cacheControl: 'no-cache'` to get the latest version.
- `downloadData` only returns the latest cached version of the file; there is [not yet an API to view prior versions](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2131).
- [Image compression](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/6081) or CloudFront CDN caching for your S3 buckets is not yet possible.
- There is no API for [Cognito Group-based access to files](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/3388).
- There is currently [no API for getting the identityId of other users](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/5177); you have to retrieve this from elsewhere before calling `Storage.get`.
