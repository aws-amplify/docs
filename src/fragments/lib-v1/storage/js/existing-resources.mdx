If you are using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used with the Amplify Libraries by running:

```bash
amplify import storage
```

For more details, see how to [Use an existing S3 bucket or DynamoDB table](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/import/).

If you are not using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used by adding it to your `Amplify.configure` statement.

<Callout warning>
  When you are not using Amplify CLI, adding existing Amazon S3 bucket to your
  application may require configuring bucket access permissions. e.g. Enabling
  read/write access to the cognito user pool that you are using with the Amplify
  Auth category.
</Callout>

```js
Amplify.configure({
  aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region: 'us-east-1', // (required) - Amazon S3 bucket region
  aws_user_files_s3_bucket: 'testappa321fb103f1f2ae6a4d25d8cd2161728123152-dev' // (required) - Amazon S3 bucket URI
});
```

- **aws_user_files_s3_bucket**: Name of the bucket to use for storage
- **aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region**: AWS Region where the bucket is provisioned (e.g. _us-east-1_)

You can also configure the resources on a scoped level by [following the steps shown here](#storage-amazon-s3).

Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](/[platform]/prev/start/project-setup/create-application/#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
