## Put

The `Put` method uploads files into Amazon S3.

It returns a `{key: S3 Object key}` object on success:

```javascript
const result = await Storage.put("test.txt", "Hello");
```

### Public level

```javascript
const result = await Storage.put("test.txt", "Hello");
```

### Protected level

```javascript
const result = await Storage.put("test.txt", "Protected Content", {
  level: "protected",
  contentType: "text/plain",
});
```

### Private level

```javascript
const result = await Storage.put("test.txt", "Private Content", {
  level: "private",
  contentType: "text/plain",
});
```

### Monitor progress of upload

To track the progress of your upload, you can use the `progressCallback`:

```javascript
Storage.put("test.txt", "File content", {
  progressCallback(progress) {
    console.log(`Uploaded: ${progress.loaded}/${progress.total}`);
  },
});
```

### Encrypted uploads

To utilize Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS, the following options can be passed in with the Put API like so:

```javascript
const serverSideEncryption = AES256 | aws:kms;
const SSECustomerAlgorithm = 'string';
const SSECustomerKey = new Buffer('...') || 'string';
const SSECustomerKeyMD5 = 'string';
const SSEKMSKeyId = 'string';

const result = await Storage.put('test.txt', 'File content', {
    serverSideEncryption, SSECustomerAlgorithm, SSECustomerKey, SSECustomerKeyMD5, SSEKMSKeyId
});
```

Other options available are:

```javascript
Storage.put("test.txt", "My Content", {
  acl: "public-read", // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#upload-property
  cacheControl: "no-cache", // (String) Specifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain
  contentDisposition: "attachment", // (String) Specifies presentational information for the object
  expires: new Date().now() + 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // (Date) The date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable. ISO-8601 string, or a UNIX timestamp in seconds
  metadata: {key: "value"}, // (map<String>) A map of metadata to store with the object in S3.
  resumable: true, // (Boolean) Allows uploads to be paused and resumed
});
```

## Pause and resume uploads

Passing the `resumable: true` option to the Put API returns an object with the following methods: `pause` , `resume`.
The `Storage.cancel` API is also available if you are looking to cancel the upload at any point of the upload.

```javascript
const upload = Storage.put(file.name, file, {
  resumable: true,
});

upload.pause();

upload.resume();

Storage.cancel(upload);
```

When a page refresh occurs during the upload, re-initializing the upload with the same file will continue from previous progress point.

```javascript
const upload = Storage.put(file.name, file, {
  resumable: true,
});


// This duplicate uploads will resume the original upload.
const duplicateUpload = Storage.put(file.name, file, {
  resumable: true,
});
```
<Callout>

Uploads that were initiated over one hour ago will be cancelled automatically. There are instances (e.g device went offline, user logs out) where the incomplete file remains in your S3 account. It is recommended to [setup a s3 lifecycle rule](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws-cloud-financial-management/discovering-and-deleting-incomplete-multipart-uploads-to-lower-amazon-s3-costs/) to automatically cleanup incomplete upload requests.

### Event handlers
With the `resumable: true` flag, there are 3 callback functions available: `completeCallback`, `progressCallback` and `errorCallback`.
```javascript
const upload = Storage.put(file.name, file, {
		resumable: true,
		completeCallback: (event) => {
			console.log(`Successfully uploaded ${event.key}`);
		},
		progressCallback: (progress) => {
			console.log(`Uploaded: ${progress.loaded}/${progress.total}`);
		},
		errorCallback: (err) => {
			console.error('Unexpected error while uploading', err);
		}
})
```

## Browser uploads

Upload an image in the browser:

```javascript
async function onChange(e) {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  try {
    await Storage.put(file.name, file, {
      contentType: "image/png", // contentType is optional
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error uploading file: ", error);
  }
}

<input type="file" onChange={onChange} />;
```

<Callout>

Note: 'contentType' is metadata (saved under the key 'Content-Type') for the S3 object and does not determine the 'Type' in the AWS S3 Console. If a file extension is not provided in the key of the uploaded object, the S3 console's 'Type' field will be omitted. Otherwise, the 'Type' will be populated to match the given extension of the key. The behavior of how the S3 object is treated will be based on 'contentType' in the metadata and not the 'Type'. 

For example: uploading a file with the key "example.jpg" will result in the 'Type' being set as "jpg", but the 'contentType' in metadata will determine it's behavior so setting it as "text/html" will result in the file being treated as an HTML file regardless of displayed 'Type' in the S3 console.

</Callout>

## React Native uploads

Upload an image in your React Native app:

```javascript
async function pathToImageFile() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(pathToImageFile);
    const blob = await response.blob();
    await Storage.put("yourKeyHere", blob, {
      contentType: "image/jpeg", // contentType is optional
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Error uploading file:", err);
  }
}
```

When a networking error happens during the upload, Storage module retries upload for a maximum of 4 attempts. If the upload fails after all retries, you will get an error.
