### Add the API plugin

Although DataStore presents a distinct API, its cloud synchronization functionality relies on the underlying [API category](/lib-v1/graphqlapi/getting-started). Therefore, you will still be required to incorporate the API plugin when working with DataStore.

Make sure you have the following plugin dependency in your `Podfile`.

```ruby
pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSAPIPlugin'
```

Then add the plugin in your Amplify initialization code alongside with the previously added `AWSDataStorePlugin`.

```swift
try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSAPIPlugin())
```
