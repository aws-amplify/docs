In order to setup your local development environment, you have two options.

### Option 1: Platform integration

### Option 2: Use Amplify CLI

Instead of using the platform integration, you can alternatively use the Amplify CLI on its own. This option is particularly **useful for existing projects** where Amplify is already configured and you want to add DataStore to it.

import all0 from "/src/fragments/lib-v1/datastore/native_common/setup-env-cli.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />
