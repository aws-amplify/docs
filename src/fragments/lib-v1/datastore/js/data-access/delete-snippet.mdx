```js
const todelete = await DataStore.query(Post, '1234567');
DataStore.delete(todelete);
```

You can also pass predicate operators to delete multiple items. For example, the following will delete all draft posts:

```js
await DataStore.delete(Post, (post) => post.status('eq', PostStatus.INACTIVE));
```

Additionally, you can perform a conditional delete. For instance, only delete **if** a post is in draft status by passing in an instance of a model:

```js
const todelete = await DataStore.query(Post, '123');
DataStore.delete(todelete, (post) => post.status('eq', PostStatus.INACTIVE));
```

Also, to delete all items for a model you can use `Predicates.ALL`:

```js
await DataStore.delete(Post, Predicates.ALL);
```
