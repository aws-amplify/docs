The [Amazon Pinpoint console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/) enables you to target your app users with push messaging. You can send individual messages or configure campaigns that target a group of users that match a profile that you define.
For instance, you could email users that have not used the app in 30 days, or send an SMS to those that frequently use a given feature of your app.

The following steps show how to receive push notifications targeted for your app.

1. Add a push listener service to your app.

    The name of the class must match the push listener service name used in the app manifest.
    `pinpointManager` is a reference to the static `PinpointManager` variable declared in
    the `MainActivity` shown in a previous step. Use the following steps to detect and display Push
    Notification in your app.

1. The following push listener code assumes that the app's `MainActivity` is configured using the manifest setup described in a previous section.

    ```java
    import android.content.Intent;
    import android.os.Bundle;
    import android.support.v4.content.LocalBroadcastManager;
    import android.util.Log;

    import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.targeting.notification.NotificationClient;
    import com.amazonaws.mobileconnectors.pinpoint.targeting.notification.NotificationDetails;
    import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService;
    import com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage;

    import java.util.HashMap;

    public class PushListenerService extends FirebaseMessagingService {
        public static final String TAG = PushListenerService.class.getSimpleName();

        // Intent action used in local broadcast
        public static final String ACTION_PUSH_NOTIFICATION = "push-notification";
        // Intent keys
        public static final String INTENT_SNS_NOTIFICATION_FROM = "from";
        public static final String INTENT_SNS_NOTIFICATION_DATA = "data";

        @Override
        public void onNewToken(String token) {
            super.onNewToken(token);

            Log.d(TAG, "Registering push notifications token: " + token);
            MainActivity.getPinpointManager(getApplicationContext()).getNotificationClient().registerDeviceToken(token);
        }

        @Override
        public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {
            super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage);
            Log.d(TAG, "Message: " + remoteMessage.getData());

            final NotificationClient notificationClient = MainActivity.getPinpointManager(getApplicationContext()).getNotificationClient();

            final NotificationDetails notificationDetails = NotificationDetails.builder()
                    .from(remoteMessage.getFrom())
                    .mapData(remoteMessage.getData())
                    .intentAction(NotificationClient.FCM_INTENT_ACTION)
                    .build();

            NotificationClient.CampaignPushResult pushResult = notificationClient.handleCampaignPush(notificationDetails);

            if (!NotificationClient.CampaignPushResult.NOT_HANDLED.equals(pushResult)) {
                /**
                   The push message was due to a Pinpoint campaign.
                   If the app was in the background, a local notification was added
                   in the notification center. If the app was in the foreground, an
                   event was recorded indicating the app was in the foreground,
                   for the demo, we will broadcast the notification to let the main
                   activity display it in a dialog.
                */
                if (NotificationClient.CampaignPushResult.APP_IN_FOREGROUND.equals(pushResult)) {
                    /* Create a message that will display the raw data of the campaign push in a dialog. */
                    final HashMap<String, String> dataMap = new HashMap<>(remoteMessage.getData());
                    broadcast(remoteMessage.getFrom(), dataMap);
                }
                return;
            }
        }

        private void broadcast(final String from, final HashMap<String, String> dataMap) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(ACTION_PUSH_NOTIFICATION);
            intent.putExtra(INTENT_SNS_NOTIFICATION_FROM, from);
            intent.putExtra(INTENT_SNS_NOTIFICATION_DATA, dataMap);
            LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(this).sendBroadcast(intent);
        }

        /**
         * Helper method to extract push message from bundle.
         *
         * @param data bundle
         * @return message string from push notification
         */
        public static String getMessage(Bundle data) {
            return ((HashMap) data.get("data")).toString();
        }
    }
    ```

1. To create a new campaign to send notifications to your app from the Amazon Pinpoint console run the following command from your app project folder.

    ```bash
    amplify notifications console
    ```

1. Provide a campaign name, choose `Next`, choose `Filter by standard attributes`, and then choose `android` as the platform.

1. You should see 1 device as a targeted endpoint, which is the app we are running on the Android device. Choose the option and then choose `Next Step`.

1. Provide text for a sample title and body for push notification, and then choose `Next Step`.

1. Choose `Immediate`, and then choose `Next Step`.

1. Review the details on the screen, and then choose `Launch Campaign`.

1. A notification should appear on the Android device. You may want to try testing your app receiving notifications when it is in the foreground and when closed.
