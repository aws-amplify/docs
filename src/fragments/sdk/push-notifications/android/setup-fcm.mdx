## Setup FCM/GCM in Firebase

You can enable your Android app to receive push notifications that you send through by using Amazon Pinpoint. With Amazon Pinpoint, you can send push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or its predecessor, Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). Before you can send push notifications through FCM or GCM, the following setup steps need to be performed:

1. Create a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message#create_a_firebase_project).

1. [Register your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message#register_your_app_with_firebase) with the Firebase project you created.

1. In the Firebase console, choose *Download google-services.json*. Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file to the `app` directory of your Android project.

To access the `Server Key`:
1. Open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

1. Choose your project.

1. Choose the settings icon next to *Project Overview* in the top left and then *Project Settings*.

1. Open the *Cloud Messaging* tab.

1. Copy the token next to *Server key*.
