## Setup FCM/GCM in Firebase

You can enable your Android app to receive push notifications that you send through by using Amazon Pinpoint. With Amazon Pinpoint, you can send push notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or its predecessor, Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). Before you can send push notifications through FCM or GCM, the following setup steps need to be performed:

1. Create a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message#create_a_firebase_project).

1. [Register your app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/first-message#register_your_app_with_firebase) with the Firebase project you created.

1. In the Firebase console, choose *Download google-services.json*. Copy the downloaded `google-services.json` file to the `app` directory of your Android project.

To access the `service account key (json file)`:
1. Open the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

1. Select the gear icon located in the top left hand corner of your screen, then select **Project settings**.

1. Select the **Service accounts** tab.

1. Select **Firebase Admin SDK** in the sidebar

1. Click **Generate new private key**

1. Keep the downloaded service account key (json file) safe. You will need to provide the path to the CLI.
