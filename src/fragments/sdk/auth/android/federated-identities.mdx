Currently, the federation feature in the AWSMobileClient supports Cognito Identity Pools only.

### Federated Sign In

```java
AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn(IdentityProvider.FACEBOOK.toString(), "FACEBOOK_TOKEN_HERE", new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(final UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {
        //Handle the result
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "sign-in error", e);
    }
});
```

`federatedSignIn()` can be used to obtain federated "Identity ID" using external providers like Google, Facebook or Twitter. If the tokens are expired and new tokens are needed, a notification will be dispatched on the `AWSMobileClient` listener with the user state `SIGNED_OUT_FEDERATED_TOKENS_INVALID`. You can give the updated tokens via the same `federatedSignIn()` method.

The API calls to get AWS credentials will be asynchronously blocked until you fetch the social provider's token and give it to `AWSMobileClient`. Once you pass the tokens, the `AWSMobileClient` will fetch AWS Credentials using the new tokens and unblock all waiting calls. It will then use the new credentials.

#### SAML with Cognito Identity

To federate your SAML sign-in provider as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your SAML application with AWS IAM by using the following [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/saml-identity-provider.html).

Once you retrieve the SAML tokens from your sign-in, you can call the `federatedSignIn` API in `AWSMobileClient`:

```java
// Perform SAML token federation
AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn("YOUR_SAML_PROVIDER_NAME", "YOUR_SAML_TOKEN", new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(final UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {
        //Handle the result
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "sign-in error", e);
});
```

**Note:**If the SAML token contains more than one Role ARN, you will need to specify which role will be assumed when federating. If the SAML token has more than one Role ARN and a `customRoleARN` is not specified, it will result in an error.

```java
// Choose one of the roles available in the token
FederatedSignInOptions options = FederatedSignInOptions.builder()
                                     .customRoleARN("choose-one")
                                     .build();
// Perform SAML token federation
AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn("YOUR_SAML_PROVIDER_NAME", "YOUR_SAML_TOKEN", options, new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
    @Override
    public void onResult(final UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {
        //Handle the result
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "sign-in error", e);
});
```

### Set up Facebook

To federate Facebook as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your application with Facebook by using the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/) and configure this with Amazon Cognito Identity Pools.

AWS Amplify helps set this up for you but first this topic explains how to set up Facebook as an identity provider for your app.

If you already have a Facebook app ID, you can copy and paste it into the `Facebook App ID` field when configuring authentication using the AWS Amplify CLI.

**To get a Facebook app ID**

Set up your app in Facebook by following Facebook's [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps) guide. Sign in to the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/):

- Choose **Add a New App** (or choose a previously created app from **My Apps**).
  - If asked, choose the platform of your app that will use Facebook Login and choose **basic setup**.
- Type a display name for your app, select a category for your app from the **Category** drop-down list, then choose **Create App ID**; take note of the **App ID**.
- In the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose **Settings**, **Basic**, then press the **+Add Platform** button.
- Choose **Android** and add your app's **Google Play Package Name** (for example, com.example.YourProjectName) and **Class Name**.
- Choose **Save changes**

Only users with roles assigned in the Facebook portal will be able to authenticate through your app while it is in development (not yet published). To authorize users, in the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose **Roles**, then **Add Testers** and provide valid Facebook IDs.

> For more information about integrating with Facebook Login see the [Facebook Login Getting Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login).

**Amplify CLI Configuration - Facebook**

In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your app files and add the auth category to your app. The CLI prompts you for configuration parameters. Choose **I will setup my own configuration** and **AWS IAM controls** when prompted.

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add auth              ##"amplify update auth" if already configured
```

```console
❯ Manual Configuration.
❯ User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls
```

Choose **YES** to `? Allow unauthenticated logins?` and **YES** to `? Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool?`

**Choose Facebook** and then provide your Facebook **App ID** that you saved earlier.

When configuration for Facebook sign-in is complete, the CLI displays a message confirming that you have configured local CLI metadata for this category. Run the following to update your changes in the cloud:

```bash
amplify push
```

You can now [configure Facebook in your mobile app](#facebook-login-in-your-mobile-app).

Note that the CLI allows you to select more than one identity provider for your app. You can also run `amplify auth update` to add an identity provider to an existing auth configuration.

### Set up Google

To federate Google as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your application with Google Sign-In in the Google Developers Console, and then configure this with Amazon Cognito Identity Pools.

To implement Google Sign-in into your iOS app, you need two things:

1. OAuth Web Client ID
2. Android Client ID

These Client IDs are part of your Google Developers project. The Web Client ID will be used by Cognito Identity Pools to manage the OAuth flow between Cognito and Google on the server side. The Android Client ID will be used in your Android app to authorize the OAuth flow directly with Google allowing your users to authenticate with Google using their Google login credentials.

> **NOTE:** The creation and configuration steps for creating OAuth Clients for Google Sign-In is constantly changing, always refer to the official setup instructions from Google.

First, navigate to the ["Start Integrating" section of the Google Developer portal](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) and click **CREATE AN OAUTH CLIENT ID** to get an OAuth client ID.

When prompted choose **Android** as the calling platform along with your Package name and certificate. Once created the **Android Client ID** will be created; take note of this value.

Next, obtain your **OAuth Web Client ID** by navigating to the [Credentials section of the Google Developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Select your project (you may need to click **All**) and under **OAuth 2.0 client IDs** copy the **Client ID** associated with the Web application type; take note of this value.

**Amplify CLI Configuration - Google**

In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your app files and add auth. The CLI prompts you for configuration parameters. Choose **I will setup my own configuration** and **AWS IAM controls** when prompted.

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add auth # or `amplify update auth`
```

```console
❯ Manual Configuration
❯ User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls
```

Choose **YES** to `? Allow unauthenticated logins?` and **YES** to `? Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool?`

Choose **Google** and then provide the **Web Client ID** and **iOS Client ID** noted above. Once complete, run the following to update your backend:

```bash
amplify push
```

You can now [configure Google in your mobile app](#google-login-in-your-mobile-app).

> Note that the CLI allows you to select more than one identity provider for your app. You can also run `amplify update auth` to add an identity provider to an existing auth configuration.

### Set up Sign in with Apple

To federate Sign in with Apple as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn()`. You must set up your application to use Sign in with Apple, and then configure Amazon Cognito Identity Pools to use Apple as an authentication provider. There are three main steps to setting up Sign in with Apple: implementing Sign in with Apple in your app, configuring Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider in your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool, and passing the Sign in with Apple token to AWSMobileClient via `federatedSignIn`.

1. **Implementing Sign in with Apple in your app**

   Since we don’t have an SDK that supports Sign in with Apple for Android, you need to use the web flow in a web view. To configure Sign in with Apple in your application, follow [Configuring Your Webpage for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/configuring_your_webpage_for_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation. To add a Sign in with Apple button to your Android user interface, follow [Displaying and Configuring Sign In with Apple Buttons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplejs/displaying_and_configuring_sign_in_with_apple_buttons) in the Apple documentation. To securely authenticate users using Sign in with Apple, follow [Configuring Your Webpage for Sign In with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/authenticating_users_with_sign_in_with_apple) in the Apple documentation.

2. **Configuring Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider in your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool**

   Once you have configured your application to use Sign in with Apple, paste your app's **Service Identifier** into the **Apple Services ID** field of your [Amazon Cognito Identity Pool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home). The Service Identifier can be found in the [**Certificates, IDs & Profiles** section](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) of your Apple Developer Account.

3. **Passing the Sign in with Apple token to AWSMobileClient via `federatedSignIn`**

   Sign in with Apple uses a session object to track its state. Amazon Cognito uses the id token from this session object to authenticate the user, generate the unique identifier, and, if needed, grant the user access to other AWS resources.

   Once you have configured Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider for your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool, and your app implements authentication with Sign in with Apple, you can retrieve the `id_token` value of the Sign in with Apple authentication response to use as the token for the `federatedSignIn` method:

   ```java
   // The onSuccess method of your app's Sign in with Apple flow

   @Override
   public void onSuccess(Bundle response) {
       String token = response.getString("id_token");

       AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn("appleid.apple.com", token, new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
           @Override
           public void onResult(final UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {
               //Handle the result
           }

           @Override
           public void onError(Exception e) {
               Log.e(TAG, "sign-in error", e);
           }
       });
   }
   ```

   After the `federatedSignIn` method successfully completes, `AWSMobileClient` will automatically use the federated identity to obtain credentials to make AWS service calls.

### Facebook Login in Your Mobile App

> **Use Android API level 23 or higher** The `AWSMobileClient` library for Android sign-in provides the activity and view for presenting a `SignInUI` for the sign-in providers you configure. This library depends on the Android SDK API Level 23 or higher.

Add the following permissions and Activity to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<activity
    android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity"
    android:exported="true">
<intent-filter>
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="@string/fb_login_protocol_scheme" />
</intent-filter>
</activity>

<meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id" />
```

Add the following dependencies to your `app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    // Mobile Client for initializing the SDK
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-mobile-client:ANDROID_SDK_VERSION'

    // Facebook SignIn
    implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:28.+'
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-facebook:ANDROID_SDK_VERSION'

    // Sign in UI
    implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.+'
    implementation 'com.amazonaws:aws-android-sdk-auth-ui:ANDROID_SDK_VERSION'
}
```

> Note: When you add the dependencies, make sure that the major version of appcompat and support libraries match. In the previous example, you're using version 28.

In `strings.xml`, add string definitions for your Facebook app ID and login protocol scheme. The value for app_id is your Facebook app ID and the value for logic_protocol_scheme should be your Facebook app ID prefixed with `fb`.

```xml
<string name="facebook_app_id">1231231231232123123</string>
<string name="fb_login_protocol_scheme">fb1231231231232123123</string>
```

Next, create an activity that will present your sign-in screen. In Android Studio, choose `File > New > Activity > Basic Activity` and type an activity name, such as `AuthenticatorActivity`. If you want to make this your starting activity, move the intent filter block containing `.LAUNCHER` to the `AuthenticatorActivity` in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<activity android:name=".AuthenticatorActivity">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

Finally, you can update the `onCreate` function of your `AuthenticatorActivity` to call `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().federatedSignIn()` as outlined earlier.

```java
import android.app.Activity;
import android.os.Bundle;

import com.amazonaws.mobile.auth.ui.SignInUI;
import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSMobileClient;
import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSStartupHandler;
import com.amazonaws.mobile.client.AWSStartupResult;

public class AuthenticatorActivity extends Activity {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_authenticator);

        AWSMobileClient.getInstance().initialize(this, new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
            @Override
            public void onResult(UserStateDetails userStateDetails) {
                Log.i("INIT", userStateDetails.getUserState());
                AWSMobileClient.getInstance().showSignIn(
                        AuthenticatorActivity.this,
                        SignInUIOptions.builder()
                                .nextActivity(NextActivity.class)
                                .build(),
                        new Callback<UserStateDetails>() {
                            @Override
                            public void onResult(UserStateDetails result) {
                                Log.d(TAG, "onResult: " + result.getUserState());
                            }

                            @Override
                            public void onError(Exception e) {
                                Log.e(TAG, "onError: ", e);
                            }
                        }
                );
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Exception e) {
                Log.e("INIT", "Error during initialization", e);
            }
        });
    }
}
```
