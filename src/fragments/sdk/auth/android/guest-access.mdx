Many applications have UX with "Guest" or "Unauthenticated" users. This is provided out of the box with `AWSMobileClient` through the initialization routine you have added. However, the Amplify CLI does not enable this by default with the `amplify add auth` flow. You can enable this by running `amplify update auth` and choosing `Manual Configuration` when prompted. Ensure you choose the **...connected with AWS IAM controls** which will allow you to select **Allow unauthenticated logins**.

When complete run `amplify push` and your `awsconfiguration.json` will work automatically with your updated Cognito settings. The `AWSMobileClient` user session will automatically have permissions configured for Guest/Unauthenticated users upon initialization. 

If you login in your app either using the "Drop-In Auth" or the `AWSMobileClient` APIs then the user session will transition to an authenticated role.

Note: If initialize is giving you the state as `SIGNED_OUT`, try calling `AWSMobileClient.getInstance().getCredentials()` and then calling initialize again.
