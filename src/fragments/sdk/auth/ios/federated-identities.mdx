## Federated Sign In

```swift
AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn(
    providerName: IdentityProvider.facebook.rawValue,
    token: "FACEBOOK_TOKEN_HERE"
) { (userState, error)  in
    if let error = error {
        print("Federated Sign In failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```

`federatedSignIn()` can be used to obtain federated "Identity ID" using external providers like Google, Facebook or Twitter. If the tokens are expired and new tokens are needed, a notification will be dispatched on the `AWSMobileClient` listener with the user state `signedOutFederationTokensInvalid`. You can give the updated tokens via the same `federatedSignIn()` method.

The API calls to get AWS credentials will be asynchronously blocked until you fetch the social provider's token and give it to `AWSMobileClient`. Once you pass the tokens, the `AWSMobileClient` will fetch AWS Credentials using the new tokens and unblock all waiting calls. It will then use the new credentials.

### SAML with Cognito Identity

To federate your SAML sign-in provider as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your SAML application with AWS IAM by using the following [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/saml-identity-provider.html).

Once you retrieve the SAML tokens from your login, you can call the `federatedSignIn` API in `AWSMobileClient`:

```swift
// Perform SAML token federation
AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn(
    providerName: "YOUR_SAML_PROVIDER_NAME",
    token: "YOUR_SAML_TOKEN"
) { (userState, error) in
    if let error = error as? AWSMobileClientError {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
    if let userState = userState {
        print("Status: \(userState.rawValue)")
    }
}

```

**Note:** If the SAML token contains more than one Role ARN, you will need to specify which role will be assumed when federating. If the SAML token has more than one Role ARN and a `customRoleARN` is not specified, it will result in an error.

```swift
// Choose one of the roles available in the token
val options = FederatedSignInOptions(customRoleARN: "choose-one")

// Perform SAML token federation
AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn(
    providerName: "YOUR_SAML_PROVIDER_NAME",
    token: "YOUR_SAML_TOKEN"
    federatedSignInOptions: options
) { (userState, error) in
    if let error = error as? AWSMobileClientError {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
    if let userState = userState {
        print("Status: \(userState.rawValue)")
    }
}
```

### Set up Facebook

To federate Facebook as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your application with Facebook by using the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/) and configure this with Amazon Cognito Identity Pools.

AWS Amplify helps set this up for you but first this topic explains how to set up Facebook as an identity provider for your app.

If you already have a Facebook app ID, you can copy and paste it into the `Facebook App ID` field when configuring authentication using the AWS Amplify CLI.

**To get a Facebook app ID**

Set up your app in Facebook by following Facebook's [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps) guide. Sign in to the [Facebook Developers portal](https://developers.facebook.com/):

- Choose **Add a New App** (or choose a previously created app from **My Apps**).
  - If asked, choose the platform of your app that will use Facebook Login and choose **basic setup**.
- Type a display name for your app, select a category for your app from the **Category** drop-down list, then choose **Create App ID**; take note of the **App ID**.
- In the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose **Settings**, then choose **+ Add Platform**.
- Choose **iOS** and add your app's Bundle ID (for example, com.amazon.YourProjectName)
- Choose **Save changes**

Only users with roles assigned in the Facebook portal will be able to authenticate through your app while it is in development (not yet published). To authorize users, in the Facebook Developer portal's left hand navigation list, choose **Roles**, then **Add Testers** and provide valid Facebook IDs.

> For more information about integrating with Facebook Login see the [Facebook Login Getting Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login).

**Amplify CLI Configuration - Facebook**

In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your app files and add the auth category to your app. The CLI prompts you for configuration parameters. Choose **I will setup my own configuration** and **AWS IAM controls** when prompted.

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add auth              ##"amplify update auth" if already configured
```

```console
❯ Manual Configuration.
❯ User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls
```

Choose **YES** to `? Allow unauthenticated logins?` and **YES** to `? Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool?`.

**Choose Facebook** and then provide your Facebook **App ID** that you saved earlier.

When configuration for Facebook sign-in is complete, the CLI displays a message confirming that you have configured local CLI metadata for this category. Run the following to update your changes in the cloud:

```bash
amplify push
```

You can now [configure Facebook in your mobile app](#facebook-login-in-your-mobile-app).

Note that the CLI allows you to select more than one identity provider for your app. You can also run `amplify auth update` to add an identity provider to an existing auth configuration.

### Set up Google

To federate Google as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn()`. You must first register your application with Google Sign-In in the Google Developers Console, and then configure this with Amazon Cognito Identity Pools.

To implement Google Sign-in into your iOS app, you need two things:

1. OAuth Web Client ID
2. iOS Client ID

These Client IDs are part of your Google Developers project. The Web Client ID will be used by Cognito Identity Pools to manage the OAuth flow between Cognito and Google on the server side. The iOS Client ID will be used in your iOS app to authorize the OAuth flow directly with Google, allowing your users to authenticate with using their Google account.

> **NOTE:** The creation and configuration steps for creating OAuth Clients for Google Sign-In is constantly changing, always refer to the official setup instructions from Google.

First, navigate to the ["Start Integrating" section of the Google Developer portal](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) and click **CREATE AN OAUTH CLIENT ID** to get an OAuth client ID.

When prompted choose **iOS** as the calling platform along with your Package name and certificate. Once created the **iOS Client ID** will be created; take note of this value.

Next, obtain your **OAuth Web Client ID** by navigating to the [Credentials section of the Google Developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). Select your project (you may need to click **All**) and under **OAuth 2.0 client IDs** copy the **Client ID** associated with the Web application type; take note of this value.

**Amplify CLI Configuration - Google**

In a terminal window, navigate to the root of your app files and add auth. The CLI prompts you for configuration parameters. Choose **I will setup my own configuration** and **AWS IAM controls** when prompted.

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add auth # or `amplify update auth`
```

```console
❯ Manual Configuration
❯ User Sign-Up, Sign-In, connected with AWS IAM controls
```

Choose **YES** to `? Allow unauthenticated logins?` and **YES** to `? Do you want to enable 3rd party authentication providers in your identity pool?`.

Choose **Google** and then provide the **Web Client ID** and **iOS Client ID** noted above. Once complete, run the following to update your backend:

```bash
amplify push
```

You can now [configure Google in your mobile app](#google-login-in-your-mobile-app).

> Note that the CLI allows you to select more than one identity provider for your app. You can also run `amplify update auth` to add an identity provider to an existing auth configuration.

### Set up Sign in with Apple

To federate Sign in with Apple as a user sign-in provider for AWS services called in your app, you will pass tokens to `AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn()`. You must set up your application to use Sign in with Apple, and then configure Amazon Cognito Identity Pools to use Apple as an authentication provider. There are three main steps to setting up Sign in with Apple: implementing Sign in with Apple in your app, configuring Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider in your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool, and passing the Sign in with Apple token to AWSMobileClient via `federatedSignIn`.

1. **Implementing Sign in with Apple in your app**

   On iOS devices, Sign in with Apple can be implemented using native controls and system-provided APIs. See [Apple's documentation and sample app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/implementing_user_authentication_with_sign_in_with_apple) for more details on setting up Sign in with Apple in your application.

2. **Configuring Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider in your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool**

   Once you have configured your application to use Sign in with Apple, paste your app's **Bundle Identifier** into the **Apple Services ID** field of your [Amazon Cognito Identity Pool](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/home). The Bundle Identifier can be found in the [**Certificates, IDs & Profiles** section](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list) of your Apple Developer Account.

   > **Note:** If you have set up Sign in with Apple for use on websites, or using Cognito HostedUI, you may have set up an Apple Services ID, but that is not the correct value to use for configuring Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider for your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool.

3. **Passing the Sign in with Apple token to AWSMobileClient via `federatedSignIn`**

   Once you have configured Sign in with Apple as an authentication provider for your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool, and your app implements authentication with Sign in with Apple, you can use the authentication tokens provided by Sign in with Apple to obtain credentials to authorize calls to AWS services in your app. When your app's [`authorizationController(controller:didCompleteWithAuthorization:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/asauthorizationcontrollerdelegate/3153050-authorizationcontroller) delegate method receives an `ASAuthorizationCredential` of type `ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential`, you can use the credential's `identityToken` to federate into your Amazon Cognito Identity Pool, as in the following sample code:

   ```swift
   func authorizationController(controller: ASAuthorizationController,
                                didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {
       guard let appleIDCredential = authorization.credential as? ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential,
           let identityTokenData = appleIDCredential.identityToken else {
               print("No token available")
               return
       }

       guard let identityToken = String(data: identityTokenData, encoding: .utf8) else {
           print("Can't convert identity token data to string")
           return
       }

       AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn(providerName: IdentityProvider.apple.rawValue,
                                                 token: identityToken) { userState, error in
           if let error = error {
               print("Error in federatedSignIn: \(error)")
               return
           }

           guard let userState = userState else {
               print("userState unexpectedly nil")
               return
           }

           print("federatedSignIn successful: \(userState)")
       }
   }
   ```

   After the `federatedSignIn` method successfully completes, `AWSMobileClient` will automatically use the federated identity to obtain credentials to make AWS service calls.

### Developer Authenticated Identities with Cognito Identity

You can register and authenticate users via your own existing authentication service while still using Amazon Cognito to access AWS resources. Using developer authenticated identities involves interaction between the end user device, your backend for authentication, and Amazon Cognito.

Begin by registering yourself with Cognito Identity in the console.

![Image](/images/dev-auth-ids-console-settings.png)

Once the a user has authenticated, the app will receive a Cognito identity ID and token confirming the sign-in with you from your servers. The app will then federate your sign-in with Cognito Identity in order to receive AWS credentials.

```swift
AWSMobileClient.default().federatedSignIn(providerName: IdentityProvider.developer.rawValue,
                                          token: "YOUR_TOKEN",
                                          federatedSignInOptions: FederatedSignInOptions(cognitoIdentityId: identityId!)) { (userState, error) in
    if let error = error as? AWSMobileClientError {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
    if let userState = userState {
        print("Status: \(userState.rawValue)")
    }
}
```

## Facebook Login in Your Mobile App

1. Add the following dependencies in your project's `Podfile`.

   ```ruby
   platform :ios, '9.0'
     target 'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
       use_frameworks!

       pod 'AWSFacebookSignIn'     # Add this new dependency
       pod 'AWSAuthUI'             # Add this dependency if you have not already added

       # Other Pod entries
       pod 'AWSMobileClient'
       pod 'AWSUserPoolsSignIn'

     end
   ```

Run `pod install --repo-update`.

> **Note:** `AWSFacebookSignIn` is only needed for using Facebook in your app and `AWSAuthUI` is only necessary if using the "Drop-In UI".

1. Add Facebook meta data to `Info.plist`.

   To configure your Xcode project to use Facebook Login, right-choose `Info.plist` and then choose `Open As > Source Code`.

   Add the following entry, using your project name, Facebook ID and login scheme ID.

```xml
  <plist version="1.0">

  <dict>
  <!-- YOUR OTHER PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->

  <!-- START OF FACEBOOK PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->
  <!-- 0123456789012345 BELOW IS EQUIVALENT TO YOUR APP ID -->
  <key>FacebookAppID</key>
  <string>0123456789012345</string>
  <key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
  <string>YOUR-PROJECT-NAME</string>
  <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
  <array>
      <string>fbapi</string>
      <string>fb-messenger-api</string>
      <string>fbauth2</string>
      <string>fbshareextension</string>
  </array>
  <!-- END OF FACEBOOK PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->

  <!-- ADD AN ENTRY TO CFBundleURLTypes for Facebook -->
  <!-- IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CFBundleURLTypes, YOU CAN COPY THE WHOLE BLOCK BELOW -->
  <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
  <array>
      <dict>
          <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
          <array>
              <string>fb0123456789012345</string>
          </array>
      </dict>
  </array>

  <!-- ... -->
  </dict>
```

The drop-in UI will show a Facebook sign in button which will use the `federatedSignIn()` flow.

## Google Login in Your Mobile App

Add the following dependencies in the Podfile.

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '9.0'
    target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
      use_frameworks!
      pod 'AWSGoogleSignIn'                 # Add this new dependency
      pod 'GoogleSignIn', '~> 4.0'          # Add this new dependency
      pod 'AWSAuthUI'                       # Add this dependency if you have not already added

      # Other Pod entries
      pod 'AWSMobileClient'
      pod 'AWSUserPoolsSignIn'

    end
    ```

Run `pod install --repo-update`.

> **Note:** `AWSGoogleSignIn` is only needed for using Google Login in your app and `AWSAuthUI` is only necessary if using the "Drop-In UI".

Add Google metadata to `Info.plist`.

To configure your Xcode project to use Google Login, open the `Info.plist` file using **Right-click > Open As > Source Code** and add the following entry. Substitute your project name for the placeholder string.

```xml

<plist version="1.0">
<!-- YOUR OTHER PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->

<!-- ADD AN ENTRY TO CFBundleURLTypes for Google -->
<!-- IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CFBundleURLTypes, YOU CAN COPY THE WHOLE BLOCK BELOW -->
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
        <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</string>
    </array>
    </dict>
</array>

<!-- ... -->
```

The drop-in UI will show a Google sign in button which will use the `federatedSignIn()` flow.
