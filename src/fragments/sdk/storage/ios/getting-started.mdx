### Overview

Enable your app to store and retrieve user files from cloud storage with the permissions model that suits your purpose. The Amplify CLI will deploy and configures cloud storage buckets using [Amazon Simple Storage Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/).

### Storage Access

The CLI configures three different access levels on the storage bucket: public, protected and private. When you run `amplify add storage`, the CLI will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using an Amazon Cognito Identity Pools IAM Role. You will have the option of adding CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) permissions as well so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted different permissions based on these levels.

If you had previously enabled user sign-in by running `amplify add auth` in your project, the policies will be connected to an `Authenticated Role` within Cognito Identity Pools which has scoped permissions to the objects in the S3 bucket prefixed by a user's Cognito Identity ID. If you haven't configured user sign-in, then an `Unauthenticated Role` will be assigned for each unique user/device combination, which will still have scoped permissions to owned objects.

* **Public**: Accessible by all users of your app. Files are stored with the `public/` prefix in your S3 bucket.
* **Protected**: Readable by all authenticated users, writable only by the owner. Files are stored with the `protected/{cognito_user_identity_id}/` prefix.
* **Private**: Only accessible by the owner. Files are stored with the `private/{cognito_user_identity_id}/` prefix.

> The `cognito_user_identity_id` corresponds to the owner's unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID. See [Authentication](/sdk/auth/working-with-api#utility-properties) for more information on how to get the `cognito_user_identity_id` for a signed in user.
 
### Set Up Your Backend

1. Complete the [Get Started](/start) steps before you proceed.

2. Use the Amplify CLI to add storage to your app.

    In a terminal window, navigate to your project root folder (the folder that contains your app's `.xcodeproj` file), and add the SDK to your app.

    ```bash
    cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
    amplify add storage
    ```

3.  Choose `Content` as your storage service.

    ```console
    ‚ùØ Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)
    ```

4. The CLI walks you through the options to enable Auth (if not enabled previously), in order to decide who should have access (select `Auth and guest users` and `read/write` for both auth and guest users).

5. Confirm that you have storage and auth set up by running `amplify status`:

    ```console
    $ amplify status
    | Category  | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
    | --------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
    | Auth      | cognito2e202b09 | Create    | awscloudformation |
    | Storage   | sabc0123de      | Create    | awscloudformation |
    ```

6. To create your backend run:

    ```bash
    amplify push
    ```

    The CLI will create the `awsconfiguration.json` file in your project directory. In the Finder, drag `awsconfiguration.json` into Xcode under the top Project Navigator folder (the folder name should match your Xcode project name). When the `Options` dialog box appears, do the following:

* Clear the `Copy items if needed` check box.
* Choose `Create groups`, and then choose `Finish`.

##### Lambda Triggers
The Amplify CLI supports associating Lambda triggers for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB events. This can be useful for a use case where you want to invoke a Lambda function after a create or update operation on a DynamoDB table managed by the CLI. [Read More](/cli/usage/lambda-triggers#s3-lambda-triggers)

### Connect to Your Backend

Use the following steps to add storage services to your app.

1. Add the `AWSS3` dependency to the `Podfile` to install the AWS Mobile SDK:

    ```ruby
    platform :ios, '9.0'

    target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
        use_frameworks!

        pod 'AWSS3'

        # other pods . . .
        pod 'AWSMobileClient'
    end
    ```

Run `pod install --repo-update` before you continue.

2. Add the following import to the classes that perform user file storage operations:

    ```swift
    import AWSS3
    ```

### Mocking and Local Testing

Amplify supports running a local mock server for testing your application with S3. Please see the [CLI Toolchain documentation](/cli/usage/mock) for more details.
