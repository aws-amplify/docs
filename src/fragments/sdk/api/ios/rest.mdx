## Overview

The Amplify CLI deploys REST APIs and handlers using [Amazon API Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/) and [AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/).

The API category will perform SDK code generation which, when used with the `AWSMobileClient` can be used for creating signed requests for Amazon API Gateway when the service Authorization is set to `AWS_IAM` or when using a [Cognito User Pools Authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html).

See [the authentication section for more details](/[platform]/sdk/auth/) for using the `AWSMobileClient` in your application.

## Set Up Your Backend

In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that contains your app `.Xcodeproj` file), and add the SDK to your app.

```bash
cd YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add api
```

When prompted select the following options:

```console
> REST
> Create a new Lambda function
> Serverless express function
> Restrict API access? Yes
> Who should have access? Authenticated and Guest users
```

When configuration of your API is complete, the CLI displays a message confirming that you have configured local CLI metadata for this category. You can confirm this by running `amplify status`. Finally deploy your changes to the cloud:

```bash
amplify push
```

Once the deployment completes a folder called `generated-src` will be added in the folder directory. This is the client SDK that you will add to your project in the next section.

## Connect to Your Backend

Add `AWSAPIGateway` to your Podfile:

```ruby
target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
    use_frameworks!

        # For API
        pod 'AWSAPIGateway'
        # other pods
end
```

Run `pod install --repo-update` and then add the `generated-src` folder and `awsconfiguration.json` file to your project **(File->Add Files to ..->Add)** and then build your project, ensuring there are no issues.

Next, set the bridging header for Swift in your project settings. Double-click your project name in the Xcode Project Navigator, choose the Build Settings tab and search for `Objective-C Bridging Header`. Enter `generated-src/Bridging_Header.h`

This is needed because the AWS generated code has some Objective-C code which requires bridging to be used for Swift. If you already have a bridging header in your app, you can just append an extra line to it: `#import "AWSApiGatewayBridge.h"` instead of above step.

The generated files determine the name of your client when making API calls. In the `generated-src` folder, files ending with name `*Client.swift` are the names of your client (without .swift extension). The path of the client code file is:

**./generated-src/YOUR_API_RESOURCE_NAME+YOUR_APP_NAME+Client.swift**

So, for an app named `useamplify` with an API resource named `xyz123`, the path of the code file might be **./generated-src/xyz123useamplifyabcdClient.swift**. The API client name would be `xyz123useamplifyabcdClient` and you would use it in your code with `xyz123useamplifyabcdClient.registerClient()` and `xyz123useamplifyabcdClient.client()`.

Find the resource name of your API by running `amplify status`. Copy your API client name to use when invoking the API in the following sections.

### IAM authorization

To invoke an API Gateway endpoint from your application, import `AWSAPIGateway` and use the generated client class, model, and resource paths as in the below example with `YOUR_API_CLIENT_NAME` replaced from the previous section. For AWS IAM authorization use the `AWSMobileClient` as outlined in [the authentication section](/[platform]/sdk/auth/).

```swift
import AWSAPIGateway
import AWSMobileClient

  // ViewController or application context . . .

func doInvokeAPI() {
    // change the method name, or path or the query string parameters here as desired
    let httpMethodName = "POST"
    // change to any valid path you configured in the API
    let URLString = "/items"
    let queryStringParameters = ["key1":"{value1}"]
    let headerParameters = [
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Accept": "application/json"
    ]

    let httpBody = "{ \n  " +
            "\"key1\":\"value1\", \n  " +
            "\"key2\":\"value2\", \n  " +
            "\"key3\":\"value3\"\n}"

    // Construct the request object
    let apiRequest = AWSAPIGatewayRequest(httpMethod: httpMethodName,
            urlString: URLString,
            queryParameters: queryStringParameters,
            headerParameters: headerParameters,
            httpBody: httpBody)

    // Create a service configuration
    let serviceConfiguration = AWSServiceConfiguration(region: AWSRegionType.USEast1,
            credentialsProvider: AWSMobileClient.default())

    // Initialize the API client using the service configuration
    xyz123useamplifyabcdClient.registerClient(withConfiguration: serviceConfiguration!, forKey: "CloudLogicAPIKey")

    // Fetch the Cloud Logic client to be used for invocation
    let invocationClient = xyz123useamplifyabcdClient.client(forKey: "CloudLogicAPIKey")

    invocationClient.invoke(apiRequest).continueWith { (task: AWSTask) -> Any? in
        if let error = task.error {
            print("Error occurred: \(error)")
            // Handle error here
            return nil
        }

        // Handle successful result here
        let result = task.result!
        let responseString = String(data: result.responseData!, encoding: .utf8)

        print(responseString)
        print(result.statusCode)

        return nil
    }
}
```

You can then invoke this method with `self.doInvokeAPI()` from your application code.

### Cognito User Pools authorization

When invoking an API Gateway endpoint with Cognito User Pools authorizer, you can leverage the `AWSMobileClient` to dynamically refresh and pass tokens to your endpoint. Using the example from the previous section, update the `doInvokeAPI()` so that it takes an argument of `token:String`. Next, add a header of `"Authorization" : token` and set the service configuration to have `credentialsProvider: nil`. Finally, overload the `doInvokeAPI()` with a new definition that gets the Cognito User Pools token from the `AWSMobileClient` as below:

```swift
//New overloaded function that gets Cognito User Pools tokens
func doInvokeAPI(){
    AWSMobileClient.default().getTokens { (tokens, err) in
        self.doInvokeAPI(token: tokens!.idToken!.tokenString!)
    }
}

//Updated function with arguments and code updates
func doInvokeAPI(token:String) {

    let headerParameters = [
            //other headers
            "Authorization" : token
    ]

    let serviceConfiguration = AWSServiceConfiguration(region: AWSRegionType.USEast1,
                                                           credentialsProvider: nil)

}
```

You can then invoke this method with `self.doInvokeAPI()` from your application code and it will pass the IdToken from Cognito User Pools as an `Authorization` header.
