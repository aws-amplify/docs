## Configure the Amplify CLI 

To set up the Amplify CLI on your local machine, you have to configure it to connect to your AWS account.

> If you already have an AWS profile with credentials on your machine, you can skip this step.

> If you are using CLI version < 10.8.0 go to [Configure CLI < 10.8.0](#configure-the-amplify-cli-version--1080)

Configure Amplify by running the following command:

```bash
amplify configure
```

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.

Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user.

> Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. You can learn more about Amazon IAM [here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

```console
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Follow the instructions at
https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install/#configure-the-amplify-cli

to complete the user creation in the AWS console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create
```

Navigate to the [IAM User creation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users/create) if it's not already open.

Enter a User name and select **Next**. You can name the user anything but we'll call it "amplify-dev".

Select **Attach policies directly** and select **AdministratorAccess-Amplify** as the Permissions policy. Select **Next**.

![Second step of creating an IAM user. Setting permissions.](/images/cli/user-creation/user-permissions.png)

On the Review page, check that everything looks good and select **Create user**.

This will redirect to the users list page. Select the user you just created.

On the user details page, navigate to the **Security credentials** tab, scroll down to **Access keys** and select **Create access keys**.

On the next page, select **Command Line Interface**, acknowledge the warning, and select **Next**.

![Command Line Interface option selected on the options list.](/images/cli/user-creation/ack-page.png)

On the next page select **Create access key**. Youâ€™ll then see a page with the access keys for the user. Use the copy icon to copy these values to your clipboard, then return to the Amplify CLI.

![Retrieve access keys page with access key and secret access key copy buttons circled.](/images/cli/user-creation/access-keys-done.png)

Enter the values you just copied into the corresponding CLI prompts.

```console
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

### Option 2: Follow the instructions

Configure Amplify by running the following command:

```bash
amplify configure
```

`amplify configure` will ask you to sign into the AWS Console.

Once you're signed in, Amplify CLI will ask you to create an IAM user.

> Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS. You can learn more about Amazon IAM [here](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).

```console
Specify the AWS Region
? region:  # Your preferred region
Specify the username of the new IAM user:
? user name:  # User name for Amplify IAM user
Complete the user creation using the AWS console
```

Create a user with `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` to your account to provision AWS resources for you like AppSync, Cognito etc.

Once the user is created, Amplify CLI will ask you to provide the `accessKeyId` and the `secretAccessKey` to connect Amplify CLI with your newly created IAM user.

```console
Enter the access key of the newly created user:
? accessKeyId:  # YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
? secretAccessKey:  # YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
This would update/create the AWS Profile in your local machine
? Profile Name:  # (default)

Successfully set up the new user.
```

It is recommended to create a new IAM user for every device that installs the Amplify CLI, rather than attempt to use an existing IAM user used on another device. Having a distinct user for each machine provides the best level of visibility and control without breaking the deployment of your app, allowing for the quick deactivation of an individual machine if needed.
