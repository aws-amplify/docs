This guide will show you how to host a static site from a GitHub repository using Amplify hosting.

In this example, you will be deploying a __React__ app, but you can also use any of the following types of projects or frameworks:

- Static HTML
- Vue
- Angular
- Solid
- Svelte

## Create a new application

```sh
npx create-react-app amplifyapp
cd amplifyapp
npm start
```

## Initialize GitHub repository

In this step, you will create a GitHub repository and commit your code to the repository. You will need a GitHub account to complete this step – if you do not have an account, sign up [here](https://github.com/join).

a. Create a new GitHub repo for your app ([link](https://github.com/new)).

b. Initialize git and push the application to the new GitHub repo by executing the following commands in your CLI:

```sh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git
git add .
git commit -m ‘initial commit’
git push origin main
```

## Deploy your app to AWS Amplify

In this step, you will connect the GitHub repository you just created to the AWS Amplify service. This will enable you to build, deploy, and host your app on AWS.

a. Sign in to your [AWS account](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and then visit the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).

b. Select **Get Started** under **Deploy**.
