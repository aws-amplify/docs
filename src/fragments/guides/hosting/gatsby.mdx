In this guide you will learn how to deploy a Gatsby site with Amplify hosting.

### Getting started

<Callout>

In this step, you will create a new Gatsby site. If you have already created a site, you can jump to the [next step](#creating-the-git-repository).

</Callout>

If you haven't already, install the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli):

```sh
# Using YARN
yarn global add gatsby-cli

# Using NPM
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

Next, create a new site and change into the new directory:

```sh
gatsby new gatsby-amplify
cd gatsby-amplify
```

### Creating the Git repository

Next, create a new Git repository and copy the URI of the repo to your clipboard.

Now, initialize the new repository within the root of your project and push the code to Git.

```sh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git # or your git repository location
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin main
```

### Deploying the site to Amplify Console Hosting
