In this guide you will learn how to deploy a Nuxt site with Amplify Hosting.

### Getting started

<Callout>

In this step, you will create a new Nuxt site. If you have already created a site, you can jump to the [next step](#creating-the-git-repository).

</Callout>

Create a new Nuxt site:

```sh
# Using YARN
yarn create nuxt-app amplify-nuxt

# Using NPM
npx create-nuxt-app amplify-nuxt
```

For the __Deployment target__, choose __Static (Static/JAMStack hosting)__.

Next, change into the new directory:

```sh
cd nuxt-amplify
```

### Creating the Git repository

Next, create a new Git repository and copy the URI of the repo to your clipboard.

Now, initialize the new repository within the root of your project and push the code to Git.

```sh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git # or your git repository location
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin main
```
