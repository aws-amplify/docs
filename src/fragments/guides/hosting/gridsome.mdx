In this guide you will learn how to deploy a Gridsome site with Amplify Hosting.

### Getting started

<Callout>

In this step, you will create a new Gridsome site. If you have already created a site, you can jump to the [next step](#creating-the-git-repository).

</Callout>

If you haven't already, install the [Gridsome CLI](https://gridsome.org/docs/):

```sh
# Using YARN
yarn global add @gridsome/cli

# Using NPM
npm install --global @gridsome/cli
```

Next, create a new site and change into the new directory:

```sh
gridsome create gridsome-amplify
cd gridsome-amplify
```

### Creating the Git repository

Next, create a new Git repository and copy the URI of the repo to your clipboard.

Now, initialize the new repository within the root of your project and push the code to Git.

```sh
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git # or your git repository location
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push origin main
```
