## Ionic 4 Components
The Angular components included in this library can optionally be presented with Ionic-specific styling.  To do so, simply include the ```AmplifyIonicModule``` alongside the ```AmplifyAngularModule```.  Then, pass in ```framework="Ionic"``` into the component.  

Example:

```html
  ...
  <amplify-authenticator framework="Ionic"></amplify-authenticator>
  ...
```

This will cause a ```ComponentFactoryResolver``` to display an Ionic version of the desired component.  You can also bypass the ```ComponentFactoryResolver``` by using the vanilla Angular or Ionic components directly using the ```-core``` or ```-ionic``` suffix.

Example:

```html
  ...
  <amplify-authenticator-ionic></amplify-authenticator-ionic>
  ...
```
