The Album component will display a list of images from the configured S3 Storage bucket. Use the *amplify-s3-album* component in your Angular view:

```html
<amplify-s3-album 
    path="pics" 
    (selected)="onAlbumImageSelected($event)">
</amplify-s3-album>
```
- `options` - object which is passed as the 'options' parameter to the .get request.  This can be used to set the 'level' of the objects being requested (i.e. 'protected', 'private', or 'public')
- `(selected)` - event used to retrieve the S3 signed URL of the clicked image:

```javascript
onAlbumImageSelected( event ) {
      window.open( event, '_blank' );
}
```
