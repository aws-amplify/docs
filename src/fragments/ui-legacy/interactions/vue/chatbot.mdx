The Chatbot component allows your users to interact with an Amazon Lex chatbot.

Usage: ```<amplify-chatbot></amplify-chatbot>```

Config:
```
<amplify-chatbot v-bind:chatbotConfig="chatbotConfig"></amplify-chatbot>
```

import vue0 from "/src/fragments/ui-legacy/interactions-attributes.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{vue: vue0}} />

Note: In order for voice input to work with Amazon Lex, you may have to enable Output voice in the AWS Console. Under the Amazon Lex service, click on your configured Lex chatbot and go to Settings -> General and pick your desired Output voice. Then, click Build. If you have forgotten to enable Output voice, you will get an error like this:
```
ChatBot Error: Invalid Bot Configuration: This bot does not have a Polly voice ID associated with it. For voice interaction with the user, set a voice ID
```

If not in your aws-exports file, the bot can also be defined in the AWS configure method:
```
 Interactions: {
    bots: {
      "BookTrip": {
        "name": "BookTrip",
        "alias": "$LATEST",
        "region": "us-east-1",
      },
    }
  }
```

Events:

* ```AmplifyEventBus.$emit('chatComplete', this.options.botTitle)```: Emitted when a chat session has been completed (only if the clearComplete options is 'true')
