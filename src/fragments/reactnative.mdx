## What we'll build

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your React Native app. You will create a “Todo app” with a GraphQL API and to store and retrieve items in a cloud database. In addition, we'll demonstrate how to authenticate users.

## Pre-requisites

The first thing you should do is initialize a new <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started" target="_blank">React Native application</a>. There are two ways to do this:

1. Expo CLI - Easier for new React Native developers
2. React Native CLI - If you are already familiar with mobile development, enables you to build native code into your project.

This tutorial will cover both, so use what's best for you.
