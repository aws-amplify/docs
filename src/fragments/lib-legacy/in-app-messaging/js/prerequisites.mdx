## Initialize the InAppMessagingSample project

The first step is to initialize a new React Native project. This can be done using Expo or the React Native CLI.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Expo">

> If this is your first time using Expo, complete the [Expo Getting Started guide](https://docs.expo.dev/) before running the below command.

```bash
expo init InAppMessagingSample
```

And select `blank` when prompted with `Choose a template`.

</Block>
<Block name="React Native CLI">

> If this is your first time using React Native (without Expo), complete the [React Native Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)  before running the below command.

```bash
npx react-native init InAppMessagingSample
```

</Block>

## Install and configure the Amplify CLI

Learn how to install and configure [Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI)](/cli/start/install/), a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app.

## Initialize Amplify

Bootstrap your project with Amplify by first navigating to your project’s root folder: 


```bash
cd InAppMessagingSample
```

Next, initialize Amplify by running the `init` command:

```bash
amplify init
```

The CLI will prompt you with configuration options.

```bash
? Enter a name for the project
  `MyAmplifyProject`
? Initialize the project with the above configuration?
  `Yes`
? Select the authentication method you want to use:
  `AWS profile`
? Please choose the profile you want to use
  `default`
```

## Set up Amplify Analytics

The easiest way to get started with In-App Messaging today is to add Amplify Analytics with Amazon Pinpoint as the provider. Using the Amplify CLI, run the following command in your project's root folder.

```bash
amplify add analytics
```

The CLI will prompt you with configuration options.

```bash
? Select an Analytics provider
  `Amazon Pinpoint`
? Provide your pinpoint resource name
  `myPinpointResourceName`
? Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guests and unauthenticated users to send analytics events? (we recommend you allow this when getting started)
  `Yes`
```

Deploy your backend with the following command:

```bash
amplify push
```

A configuration file called `aws-exports.js` will be copied to your configured source directory, for example `./src`.

## Update configuration file

You will need to update `aws-exports.js` manually to configure In-App Messaging. Add the configuration for In-App Messaging to the exported `awsmobile` variable with both the Pinpoint project ID (created when Analytics was deployed) as well as the AWS region to which it was deployed. You can find your Project ID by navigating to the AWS console, and searching for Amazon Pinpoint, then clicking on the All projects section.

```js
const awsmobile = {
  ...
  "Notifications": {
    "InAppMessaging": {
      "AWSPinpoint": {
        "appId": "<pinpoint-project-id>",
        "region": "<aws-region>",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Create and attach IAM policy

Finally, you will need to grant your users access to Amazon Pinpoint’s **GetInAppMessages** API. In order to do this, create an IAM policy.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Policies**.
3. Select **Create policy**.
4. On the **Visual editor** tab, select the following:
   1. Service: **Pinpoint**
   2. Actions: **GetInAppMessages**
      ![Pinpoint-Actions](/images/lib/in-app-messaging/pinpoint-console-policy-action.png)
   3. Resources: **arn:aws:mobiletargeting:<region\>:<account-id\>:apps/<pinpoint-project-id\>\***
      - Click on "Specific" and then click on "Add ARN"
      ![In-App-Messaging](/images/lib/in-app-messaging/add-resource-arn.png)
      - The “account-id” will be populated by default.
      - The pinpoint-project-id can be found from the pinpoint page, and then clicking on the “All Projects” button in the navigation menu.

5. When you are finished, choose **Next: Tags**. Here you can optionally add metadata to the policy and when you are finished, choose **Next: Review**.
6. On the **Review policy** page, type a **Name** for the policy that you are creating. Review the policy summary to make sure that you have granted the intended permissions, and then choose **Create policy** to save your new policy.

When creating an Amplify Analytics backend with Pinpoint as your provider, Amplify will automatically create IAM roles for your users to assume. The roles should have similar naming schemes to the following:

- `amplify-<amplify-project-name>-<environment>-######-authRole`
- `amplify-<amplify-project-name>-<environment>-######-unauthRole`

Find them in your IAM console and attach the policy created above.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [AWS IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the navigation pane, select _Policies_.
3. In the list of policies, find and select the check box next to the name of the policy you created above. You can use the search box to filter the list of policies.
4. Select _Actions_, and then select _Attach_.
5. Find and select the roles you you need to grant In-App Messaging permissions to. You can use the search box to filter the list. After selecting the roles, select _Attach policy_.
