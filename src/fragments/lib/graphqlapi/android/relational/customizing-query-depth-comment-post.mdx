        }
    },
    failure -> Log.e("MyAmplifyApp", "Failed to fetch post", failure)
);
```

This will populate the selection set of the post in the GraphQL document which indicates to your GraphQL service to retrieve the post model as part of the operation. Once the comment is loaded, the post model is immediately available in-memory without requiring an additional network request.
