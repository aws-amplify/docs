## Complex objects
Many times you might want to create logical objects that have more complex data, such as images or videos, as part of their structure. For example, you might create a Person type with a profile picture or a Post type that has an associated image. With AWS AppSync, you can model these as GraphQL types, referred to as complex objects. If any of your mutations have a variable with bucket, key, region, mimeType and localUri fields, the SDK uploads the file to Amazon S3 for you.

For a complete working example of this feature, see [aws-amplify-graphql](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-amplify-graphql) on GitHub.

The GraphQL transformer will configure your resolvers to write to DynamoDB and point at S3 objects when using the `S3Object` type. For example, run the following in an Amplify project:

```bash
amplify add auth        #Select default configuration
amplify add storage     #Select S3 with read/write access
amplify add api         #Select Cognito User Pool for authorization type
```

When prompted, use the following schema:
```graphql
type Todo @model {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    description: String!
    file: S3Object
}

type S3Object {
    bucket: String!
    key: String!
    region: String!
}

input CreateTodoInput {
  id: ID
  name: String!
  description: String
  file: S3ObjectInput # This input type will be generated for you
}
```
Save and run `amplify push` to deploy changes.

To use complex objects you need AWS Identity and Access Management credentials for reading and writing to Amazon S3 which `amplify add auth` configured in the default setting along with a Cognito user pool. These can be separate from the other auth credentials you use in your AWS AppSync client. Credentials for complex objects are set using the `complexObjectsCredentials` parameter, which you can use with AWS Amplify and the complex objects feature like so:

```javascript
const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
    url: ENDPOINT,
    region: REGION,
    auth: { ... },   //Can be User Pools or API Key
    complexObjectsCredentials: () => Auth.currentCredentials(),
});

(async () => {
  let file;

  if (selectedFile) { // selectedFile is the file to be uploaded, typically comes from an <input type="file" />
    const { name, type: mimeType } = selectedFile;
    const [, , , extension] = /([^.]+)(\.(\w+))?$/.exec(name);

    const bucket = aws_config.aws_user_files_s3_bucket;
    const region = aws_config.aws_user_files_s3_bucket_region;
    const visibility = 'private';
    const { identityId } = await Auth.currentCredentials();
    
    const key = `${visibility}/${identityId}/${uuid()}${extension && '.'}${extension}`;

    file = {
      bucket,
      key,
      region,
      mimeType,
      localUri: selectedFile,
    };
  }

  const result = await client.mutate({
    mutation: gql(createTodo),
    variables: {
      input: {
        name: 'Upload file',
        description: 'Uses complex objects to upload',
        file: file,
      }
    }
  });

})();
```

When you run the above mutation a record will be in a DynamoDB table for your AppSync API as well as the corresponding file in an S3 bucket.
