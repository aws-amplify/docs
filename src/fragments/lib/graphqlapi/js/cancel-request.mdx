## CANCEL API requests

You may cancel any query or mutation request made through API category by keeping a reference to the promise returned.

```javascript
const promise = client.graphql({ query: "..." });

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (API.isCancel(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
client.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `client.graphql()` has not been modified. Typically async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will not work

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return client.graphql({ query: '...' });
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
client.cancel(promise, 'my error message');
```
