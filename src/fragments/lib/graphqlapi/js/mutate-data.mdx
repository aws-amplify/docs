## Using Amplify GraphQL client

### Mutations

In GraphQL, mutations are used to create, update, or delete data. Here are some examples of creating, updating, and deleting items using the Amplify GraphQL client.

#### Creating an item

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const client = generateClient();

const newTodo = await client.graphql({
  query: mutations.createTodo,
  variables: {
    input: {
      name: 'Todo 1',
      description: 'Learn AWS AppSync'
    }
  }
});
```

You do not have to pass in `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, AppSync manages this for you.

#### Updating an item

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const client = generateClient();

const updatedTodo = await client.graphql({
  query: mutations.updateTodo,
  variables: {
    input: {
      id: 'some_id',
      description: 'Updated description'
    }
  }
});
```

Notes:

- You do not have to pass in `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, AppSync manages this for you.
- If you pass in _extra_ input fields not expected by the AppSync schema, this query will fail. You can see this in the `error` field returned by the query (the query itself does not throw, per GraphQL design).

#### Deleting an item

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const client = generateClient();

const deletedTodo = await client.graphql({
  query: mutations.deleteTodo,
  variables: {
    input: {
      id: 'some_id'
    }
  }
});
```

Only the identifier fields are required for delete mutations.

<Callout>
  Join table records must be deleted prior to deleting the associated records.
  For example, for a many-to-many relationship between Posts and Tags, delete
  the PostTags join record prior to deleting a Post or Tag.
</Callout>

### Custom authorization mode

By default, each AppSync API will be set with a default authorization mode when you configure your app. If you would like to override the default authorization mode, you can do so by passing in an `authMode` property.

#### Mutation with custom authorization mode

```ts
import { generateClient } from 'aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const client = generateClient();

const todoDetails: CreateTodoInput = {
  id: 'some_id',
  name: 'My todo!',
  description: 'Hello world!'
};

const todo = await client.graphql({
  query: mutations.createTodo,
  variables: {
    input: {
      id: 'some_id',
      name: 'My todo!',
      description: 'Hello world!'
    }
  },
  authMode: 'iam'
});
```
