<!-- TODO Rewrite needs a better intro and description to subscriptions in general - and why a dev would use them -->

## Using Amplify GraphQL client

Subscriptions is a GraphQL feature allowing the server to send data to its clients when a specific event happens. You can enable real-time data integration in your app with a subscription.

```javascript
import { Amplify, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as subscriptions from './graphql/subscriptions';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const subscription = API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
  next: ({ provider, value }) => console.log({ provider, value }),
  error: (error) => console.warn(error)
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

When using **AWS AppSync** subscriptions, be sure that your AppSync configuration is at the root of the configuration object, instead of being under API:

```javascript
Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    identityPoolId: 'xxx',
    region: 'xxx',
    cookieStorage: {
      domain: 'xxx',
      path: 'xxx',
      secure: true
    }
  },
  aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_region: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'xxxx',
  aws_appsync_apiKey: 'xxxx'
});
```

Subscriptions take an optional `filter` argument to define service-side subscription filters:

```graphql
// Only subscribe to creation of Todo, if the todo "type" is "Personal"
const subscription = API.graphql(
    graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onCreateTodo, {
      filter: {
        type: { eq: "Personal" }
      }
    })
).subscribe({
    next: ({ provider, value }) => console.log({ provider, value }),
    error: error => console.warn(error)
});
```

If you want to get all subscription events, don’t pass any `filter` parameters.

**Important**: Passing an empty object `{}` as a filter is NOT recommended. Using `{}` as a filter might cause inconsistent behavior based on your data model's authorization rules.

### Subscription connection status updates

Now that your application is setup and using subscriptions, you may want to know when the subscription is finally established, or reflect to your users when the subscription isn't healthy. You can monitor the connection state for changes via Hub.

```typescript
import { CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE, ConnectionState } from '@aws-amplify/pubsub';
import { Hub } from 'aws-amplify';

Hub.listen('api', (data: any) => {
  const { payload } = data;
  if (payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE) {
    const connectionState = payload.data.connectionState as ConnectionState;
    console.log(connectionState);
  }
});
```

import jsConnectionStates from '/src/fragments/lib/pubsub/js/connection-states.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: jsConnectionStates }} />

### Connection issues and automated reconnection

import jsReconnectDescription from '/src/fragments/lib/pubsub/js/reconnect-description.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: jsReconnectDescription }} />

```typescript
const fetchRecentData = () => {
  // Retrieve some/all data from a appsync
  const allTodos = await API.graphql({ query: queries.listTodos });
}

let priorConnectionState: ConnectionState;

Hub.listen("api", (data: any) => {
  const { payload } = data;
  if (
    payload.event === CONNECTION_STATE_CHANGE
  ) {

    if (priorConnectionState === ConnectionState.Connecting && payload.data.connectionState === ConnectionState.Connected) {
      fetchRecentData();
    }
    priorConnectionState = payload.data.connectionState;
  }
});

const createSubscription = (API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onCreateTodo)
) as unknown as ZenObservable<object>).subscribe({
  next: data => // Process incoming messages
});

const updateSubscription = (API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onUpdateTodo)
) as unknown as ZenObservable<object>).subscribe({
  next: data => // Process incoming messages
});

const deleteSubscription = (API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(subscriptions.onDeleteTodo)
) as unknown as ZenObservable<object>).subscribe({
  next: data => // Process incoming messages
});

const cleanupSubscriptions = () => {
  createSubscription.unsubscribe();
  updateSubscription.unsubscribe();
  deleteSubscription.unsubscribe();
}
```
