For offline scenarios, Amplify provides [DataStore](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/set-up-datastore/).

[Amplify DataStore](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/set-up-datastore/) uses AWS AppSync to make it easy to build apps that need to support offline and low-latency scenarios. DataStore also makes working with distributed, cross-user data just as simple as working with local-only data by providing a programming model for leveraging shared and distributed data without writing additional code.

To learn more about building offline-first apps with DataStore, check out the documentation [here](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/datastore/set-up-datastore/).
