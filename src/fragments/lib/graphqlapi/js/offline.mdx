For offline scenarios, Amplify provides two SDKS.

[Amplify DataStore](/lib/datastore/getting-started) uses AWS AppSync to make it easy to build apps that need to support offline and low-latency scenarios. DataStore also makes working with distributed, cross-user data just as simple as working with local-only data by providing a programming model for leveraging shared and distributed data without writing additional code.

The [AWS AppSync SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-js/) provides offline support and enables you to integrate your app with the AWS AppSync service and integrates with the Apollo client found [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/).

To learn more about building offline-first apps with DataStore, check out the documentation [here](/lib/datastore/getting-started).

## AWS AppSync Client SDK

The AppSync client SDK supports offline scenarios with a programing model that provides a "write through cache". This allows you to both render data in the UI when offline as well as add/update through an "optimistic response". The below diagram shows how the AppSync client interfaces with the network GraphQL calls, it's offline mutation queue, the Apollo cache, and your application code.

Your application code will interact with the AppSync client to perform GraphQL queries, mutations, or subscriptions. The AppSync client automatically performs the correct authorization methods when interfacing with the HTTP layer adding API Keys, tokens, or signing requests depending on how you have configured your setup. When you do a mutation, such as adding a new item (like a blog post) in your app the AppSync client adds this to a local queue (persisted to disk with Local Storage, AsyncStorage, or other mediums depending on your JavaScript platform configuration) when the app is offline. When network connectivity is restored the mutations are sent to AppSync in serial allowing you to process the responses one by one. 

Any data returned by a query is automatically written to the Apollo Cache (e.g. “Store”) that is persisted to the configured medium. The cache is structured as a key value store using a reference structure. There is a base “Root Query” where each subsequent query resides and then references their individual item results. You specify the reference key (normally “id”) in your application code. An example of the cache that has stored results from a “listPosts” query and “getPost(id:1)” query is below.

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| ROOT_QUERY | [ROOT_QUERY.listPosts, ROOT_QUERY.getPost(id:1)]
| ROOT_QUERY.listPosts | {0, 1, …,N} |
| Post:0 |{author:"Nadia", content:"ABC"} |
| Post:1 | {author:"Shaggy", content:"DEF"} |
| ... | ... |
| Post:N | {author:"Pancho", content:"XYZ"} |
| ROOT_QUERY.getPost(id:1) |ref: $Post:1 |

Notice that the cache keys are normalized where the `getPost(id:1)` query references the same element that is part of the `listPosts` query. This happens automatically in JavaScript applications by using `id` as a common cache key to uniquely identify the objects. You can choose to change the cache key with the `cacheOptions :{ dataIdFromObject }` method when creating the `AWSAppSyncClient`:

```javascript
const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.aws_appsync_region,
  auth: {
    type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY,
    apiKey: awsconfig.aws_appsync_apiKey,
  },
  cacheOptions: {
    dataIdFromObject: (obj) => `${obj.__typename}:${obj.myKey}`
  }
});
```

If you are performing a mutation, you can write an “optimistic response” anytime to this cache even if you are offline. You use the AppSync client to connect by passing in the query to update, reading the items off the cache. This normally returns a single item or list of items, depending on the GraphQL response type of the query to update. At this point you would add to the list, remove, or update it as appropriate and write back the response to the store persisting it to disk. When you reconnect to the network any responses from the service will overwrite the changes as the authoritative response. We'll give some examples of that in [Offline mutations](#offline-mutations).

## Configuration Options

`disableOffline`: If you don't need/want offline capabilities, this option skips the creation of a local store to persist the cache and mutations made while offline.

```javascript
const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.aws_appsync_region,
  auth: {
    type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY,
    apiKey: awsconfig.aws_appsync_apiKey,
  },
  disableOffline: true
});
```

`conflictResolver`: 
When clients make a mutation, either online or offline, they can send a version number with the payload (named `expectedVersion`) for AWS AppSync to check before writing to Amazon DynamoDB. A DynamoDB resolver mapping template can be configured to perform conflict resolution in the cloud, which you can learn about in the [AppSync Resolver Mapping Template Reference for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb.html#aws-appsync-resolver-mapping-template-reference-dynamodb-condition-expressions). If the service determines it needs to reject the mutation, data is sent to the client and you can optionally run a "custom conflict resolvers" to perform client-side conflict resolution.

- **mutation**: GraphQL statement of a mutation
- **mutationName**: Optional if a name of a mutation is set on a GraphQL statement
- **variables**: Input parameters of the mutation
- **data**: Response from AWS AppSync of actual data in DynamoDB
- **retries**: Number of times a mutation has been retried

An example below of passing a `conflictResolver` to the `AWSAppSyncClient` object:

```javascript
const conflictResolver = ({ mutation, mutationName, variables, data, retries }) => {
    switch (mutationName) {
        case 'UpdatePostMutation':
            return {
                ...variables,
                expectedVersion: data.version,
            };
        default:
            return false;
    }
}

const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.aws_appsync_region,
  auth: {
    type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY,
    apiKey: awsconfig.aws_appsync_apiKey,
  },
  conflictResolver: conflictResolver
});
```

In the previous example, you could do a logical check on the mutationName. If you return an object with variables for the mutation, this will automatically rerun the mutation with the correct version that AWS AppSync returned.

**Note**: We recommend doing this only in rare cases. Usually, we recommend that you let the AWS AppSync service define conflict resolution to prevent race conditions from occurring. If you don't want to retry, simply return `"DISCARD"`.

### Offline configuration

When using the AWS AppSync SDK offline capabilities (e.g. `disableOffline: false`), you can provide configurations in the `offlineConfig` key:

- Error handling: (`callback`)
- Custom storage engine (`storage`)
- A key prefix for the underlying store (`keyPrefix`)

### Error handling

If a mutation is done while the app was offline, it gets persisted to the platform storage engine. When coming back online, it is sent to the GraphQL endpoint. When a response is returned by the API, the SDK will notify you of the success or error using the callback provided in the `offlineConfig` parameter as follows:

```javascript
const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.aws_appsync_region,
  auth: {
    type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY,
    apiKey: awsconfig.aws_appsync_apiKey,
  },
  offlineConfig: {
    callback: (err, succ) => {
      if(err) {
        const { mutation, variables } = err;

        console.warn(`ERROR for ${mutation}`, err);
      } else {
        const { mutation, variables } = succ;

        console.info(`SUCCESS for ${mutation}`, succ);
      }
    },
  },
});
```

**NOTE** If the app was closed and you re-opened it and there were errors this would be represented in the error callback above. However, if you're doing a mutation and the app is still online and the server rejects the write, you will need to handle it with a standard `try/catch`:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const variables = {
    input: {
        name: 'Use AppSync',
        description: 'Realtime and Offline',
    }
  };

  try {
    const result = await client.mutate({
      mutation: gql(createTodo),
      variables: variables
    });
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Error sending mutation: ',  e);
    console.warn(variables); // Do something with the data
  }
})();
```

**NOTE** The SDK will automatically retry for standard network errors, however access errors or other unrelated errors you will need to handle them yourself.

### Custom storage engine

You can use any custom storage engine from the [redux-persist supported engines](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#storage-engines) list.

Configuration is done as follows: (localForage shown in the example)

```javascript
import * as localForage from "localforage";

const client = new AWSAppSyncClient({
  url: awsconfig.aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint,
  region: awsconfig.aws_appsync_region,
  auth: {
    type: AUTH_TYPE.API_KEY,
    apiKey: awsconfig.aws_appsync_apiKey,
  },
  offlineConfig: {
    storage: localForage,
  },
});
```

### Key prefix

The `AWSAppSyncClient` persists its cache data to support offline scenarios. Keys in the persisted cache will be prefixed by the provided `keyPrefix`.

This prefix is required when offline support is enabled and you want to use more than one client in your app (e.g. by [accessing a multi-auth enabled AppSync API](#aws-appsync-multi-auth))

## Offline Mutations

As outlined in the architecture section, all query results are automatically persisted to disk with the AppSync client. For updating data through mutations when offline you will need to use an "optimistic response" by writing directly to the store. This is done by querying the store directly with `cache.readQuery({query: someQuery})` to pull the records for a specific query that you wish to update. You can do this manually with `update` functions or use the `buildMutation` and `buildSubscription` built-in helpers that are part of the AppSync SDK (we strongly recommended using these helpers).

You can find the [Offline Helpers documentation here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-js/blob/master/OFFLINE_HELPERS).

The `update` functions can be called two or more times when using an `optimisticResponse` depending on the number of mutation you have in your offline queue **and** if you are currently offline. This is because the Apollo client will call the function once for the local optimistic write and a second time for the server response. You can read more about this in the [Apollo documentation for cache updates](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/mutations/#updating-the-cache-after-a-mutation). The AppSync client when offline will automatically resolve the promise for the server response and place your mutation in a queue for later processing. When you come back online, each item in the queue will be executed in serial and its corresponding `update` function will run as well as triggering the optimistic update of the pending items in the queue. This is to ensure that the cache is consistent when rendering the UI. Note that this means that your `update` functions should be *idempotent*.

For example, the below code shows how you would update the `CreateTodoMutation` mutation from earlier by creating a `optimisticWrite(CreateTodoInput createTodoInput)` helper method that has the same input. This adds an item to the cache by first adding query results to a local array with `items.addAll(response.data().listTodos().items())` followed by the individual update using `items.add()`. You commit the record with `client.getStore().write()`. This example uses a locally generated unique identifier which might be enough for your app, however if the AppSync response returns a different value for `ID` (which many times is the case as best practice is generation of IDs at the service layer) then you will need to replace the value locally when a response is received. This can be done in the `onResponse()` method of the top level mutation callback by again querying the store, removing the item and calling `client.getStore().write()`.

### With helper

An example of using the `buildMutation` helper to add an item to the cache:

```javascript
import { buildMutation } from 'aws-appsync';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { createTodo, CreateTodoInput } from './graphql/mutations';

(async () => {
  const result = await client.mutate(buildMutation(client,
    gql(createTodo),
    {
      inputType: gql(CreateTodoInput),
      variables: {
        input: {
          name: 'Use AppSync',
          description: 'Realtime and Offline',
        }
      }
    },
    (_variables) => [ gql(listTodos) ],
    'Todo'));

  console.log(result);
})();
```

### Without helper

An example of writing an `update` function manually to add an item to the cache:

```javascript
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { createTodo } from './graphql/mutations';

(async () => {
  const result = await client.mutate({
    mutation: gql(createTodo),
    variables: {
      input: {
        name: 'Use AppSync',
        description: 'Realtime and Offline',
      }
    },
    optimisticResponse: () => ({
      createTodo: {
        __typename: 'Todo', // This type must match the return type of the query below (listTodos)
        id: uuid(),
        name: 'Use AppSync',
        description: 'Realtime and Offline',
      }
    }),
    update: (cache, { data: { createTodo } }) => {
      const query = gql(listTodos);

      // Read query from cache
      const data = cache.readQuery({ query });

      // Add newly created item to the cache copy
      data.listTodos.items = [
        ...data.listTodos.items.filter(item => item.id !== createTodo.id),
        createTodo
      ];

      //Overwrite the cache with the new results
      cache.writeQuery({ query, data });
    }
  });

  console.warn(result);
})();
```

You might add similar code in your app for updating or deleting items using an optimistic response, it would look largely similar except that you might overwrite or remove an element from the `data.listTodos.items` array.
