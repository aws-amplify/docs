# Connect a data stack
In this guide, you will learn how to connect an existing data stack to your application. This job includes understanding the required client configuration and how to connect the data stack. We will also review functions to create, read, update, and delete your data using the Amplify GraphQL client. Finally, we will look at how to subscribe to real-time events to watch for mutations in your data.

## Review the required configuration

In this job, you will configure your client to point to the AWS AppSync API endpoint. You will first need to understand how to configure the Amplify API category and update the authentication type to complete this job. An understanding of the differences between authentication types will also be helpful if you did not set up the data stack yourself.

> **Before you begin, you will need:**
> - An AWS AppSync API already set up ([Designing a GraphQL API in AppSync]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/designing-a-graphql-api.html)]
> - An application set up ([instructions to set up an app](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/project-setup/create-application/q/platform/js/))

### Configure the client to point to the AWS AppSync API endpoint and update authentication details

[comment]: # (This section includes both a short intro that helps to explain how to configure the Amplify API category and the steps to configure the client. Also includes a short review of the auth types and steps to update their details required in this command. Content copied and updated from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/edit/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/existing-resources.mdx )

[question]: # (Do we need any content from these pages for this job? 1- https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/client-configuration/configuring-amplify-categories/q/platform/js/#graphql-api-aws-appsync ; 2- https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/client-code-generation/#amplify-add-codegen ; 3- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/building-a-client-app.html )

You can use existing AWS AppSync resources by referencing the AWS AppSync API endpoint and configuring the parameters in your app. The API URL, ID, and Key can be found in the AWS AppSync console in the Settings section. 
You will need to know your Authentication type to complete this step. Authentication type options are `API_KEY`, `AWS_IAM`, `AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS` and `OPENID_CONNECT`.

#### Review differences between authentication types 

[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION to provide a deeper dive on authentication types and their differences, including API key access, Cognito, IAM, and OIDC. May be an option for a table that compares the authentication types. Content copied and updated from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/pages/cli/graphql/authorization-rules.mdx However, I would suggest we rewrite this intro sentence to provide more foundational explanation that we can then reuse.)

Below is a short comparison between the different authentication types and their use cases. 

| **Recommended use case** | **Strategy** | **Provider** |
|---|---|---|
| Public data access where users or devices are anonymous. Anyone with the AppSync API key is granted access. | [`public`]() | `apiKey` |
| Recommended for production environment's public data access. Public data access where unauthenticated users or devices are granted permissions using AWS IAM controls. | [`public`]() | `iam` |
| Per user data access. Access is restricted to the "owner" of a record. Leverages `amplify add auth` Cognito user pool by default. | [`owner`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Any signed-in data access. Unlike owner-based access, **any** signed-in user has access. | [`private`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` / `iam` |
| Per user group data access. A specific or dynamically configured group of users have access | [`group`]() | `userPools` / `oidc` |
| Define your own custom authorization rule within a Lambda function | [`custom`]() | `function` |

Once you have these details you can configure the client:

#### Using with an AppSync custom domain name

[Custom domain names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/custom-domain-name.html) can be used to create a memorable endpoint with a domain name of your choice. These can have any format, but must end with `/graphql` (see https://graphql.org/learn/serving-over-http/#uris-routes). Using custom domain names will impact how you enter your graphqlEndpoint:

```javascript
const myAppConfig = {
  // ...
  aws_appsync_graphqlEndpoint: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/graphql',
  aws_appsync_region: 'us-east-1',
  aws_appsync_authenticationType: 'API_KEY' // All auth modes are supported
  // ...
};

Amplify.configure(myAppConfig);
```

[question]: # (Do we want to address non-AppSync on this job or link to it? )

### Using a non-AppSync GraphQL Server

To access a non-AppSync GraphQL API with your app, you need to configure the endpoint URL in your app’s configuration. Add the following line to your setup:

```js
import { Amplify, API } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

// Considering you have an existing aws-exports.js configuration file
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

// Configure a custom GraphQL endpoint
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https:/www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint'
  }
});
```

#### Set Custom Request Headers for non-AppSync GraphQL APIs

When working with a non-AppSync GraphQL endpoint, you may need to set request headers for authorization purposes. This is done by passing a `graphql_headers` function into the configuration:

```js
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_headers: async () => ({
      'My-Custom-Header': 'my value'
    })
  }
});
```

#### Signing Request with IAM

AWS Amplify provides the ability to sign requests automatically with AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) for GraphQL requests that are processed through AWS API Gateway. Add the `graphql_endpoint_iam_region` parameter to your GraphQL configuration statement to enable signing:

```js
Amplify.configure({
  API: {
    graphql_endpoint: 'https://www.example.com/my-graphql-endpoint',
    graphql_endpoint_iam_region: 'my_graphql_apigateway_region'
  }
});
```

### Recap
At this point your client is now configured to point to your AppSync API endpoint and you updated your authentication details based on the auth types you are using.

## Connect your application code to the data backend
In this job, you will connect your application code to the data stack by connecting and configuring the Amplify libraries. We will review how to install and configure Amplify libraries to help you complete this task.
> **Before you begin, you will need:**
> - npm installed ([set up npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started))
> - Data stack deployed

### Install and configure the Amplify libraries

[comment]: # (Task-forward section with steps to install and configure, with an explanation on the flow differences between the Amplify API and their existing API. Updated content from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/JTBD-Data/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/getting-started.mdx but still missing the discussion on differences with their own API. Added fragment into text so can be updated as needed for guide first - https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/react-native-configure.mdx) 

Add the `aws-amplify` package to your app with `yarn` or `npm`. This is the main library for working with Amplify Libraries in your projects. This will include connecting your app with the GraphQL endpoint.

Add Amplify to your app with `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @react-native-community/netinfo
```

In your app's entry point i.e. **App.js** (Expo) or **index.js** (React Native CLI), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

#### Install Amplify Libraries for Angular

Inside the `amplify-app` directory, install the Amplify Angular library and run your app:

```bash
npm install --save aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-angular

npm start
```

The `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` package is a set of Angular components and an Angular provider which helps integrate your application with the AWS-Amplify library.

##### Strictly typing `aws-exports`

If you have TypeScript [strict mode](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strict) on and see the error

```
Could not find a declaration file for module './aws-exports'. 'aws-exports.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

Create a `aws-exports.d.ts` file on the same level as aws-exports with the following content:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile;
```

##### Importing the Amplify Angular UI Module

Add the **Amplify Authenticator UI Module** to `src/app/app.module.ts`:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AmplifyAuthenticatorModule } from '@aws-amplify/ui-angular';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [

## Create, update, and delete application data
In this job, you will run mutations to create, update, and delete application data. We will also show you how to cancel these requests.

> - Your application connected to the API

### Run mutations to create, update, and delete application data
  
[comment]: # (Short intro to review mutations with the Amplify GraphQL client.)
  
In GraphQL, mutations write data to the API and are used to create, update, or delete data. 

#### Learn more about GraphQL mutations

[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION that covers GraphQL basics, mutations, and why this is helpful—can be a short summary with recommended links.)

Here are some examples of creating, updating, and deleting items using the Amplify GraphQL client.

[comment]: # (Steps to run with the Amplify GraphQL client taken from: 1- https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/mutate-data.mdx and 2- https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/pages/cli/graphql/overview.mdx.)

#### Creating an item
You can create an item by first importing the API and mutations. Then you can add an item:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { CreateTodoInput, CreateTodoMutation } from './API';

const todoDetails: CreateTodoInput = {
  name: 'Todo 1',
  description: 'Learn AWS AppSync'
};

const newTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<CreateTodoMutation>>({ 
  query: mutations.createTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

You should see the item created: `Learn AWS AppSync`.


</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const todoDetails = {
  name: 'Todo 1',
  description: 'Learn AWS AppSync'
};

const newTodo = await API.graphql({ 
  query: mutations.createTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

You should see the item created: `Learn AWS AppSync`.

</Block>

<Block name="CLI">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify'
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations'

const result = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {
  input: {
    name: 'My first todo!'
  }
}))
```

You should see the item created: `My first todo!`.

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

You do not have to pass in `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, AppSync manages this for you.

You can optionally import the `graphqlOperation` helper function to help you construct the argument object:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
// ...
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';

// equivalent to above example
const newTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<CreateTodoMutation>>(
  graphqlOperation(mutations.createTodo, { input: todoDetails })
);
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
// ...
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';

// equivalent to above example
const newTodo = await API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(mutations.createTodo, { input: todoDetails })
);
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

#### Updating an item
To update the item use the GraphQL update mutation:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { UpdateTodoInput, UpdateTodoMutation } from './API';

const todoDetails: UpdateTodoInput = {
  id: 'some_id',
  description: 'Updated description'
};

const updatedTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<UpdateTodoMutation>>({ 
  query: mutations.updateTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const todoDetails = {
  id: 'some_id',
//  _version: 'current_version', // add the "_version" field if your AppSync API has conflict detection (required for DataStore) enabled
  description: 'Updated description'
};

const updatedTodo = await API.graphql({ 
  query: mutations.updateTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="CLI">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify'
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations'

const result = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(updateTodo, {
  input: {
    id: "<...>",
    name: "My first updated todo!"
  }
}))
console.log(result)
```

The result should contain the updated value: `My first updated todo!`.

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Notes:

- You do not have to pass in `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields, AppSync manages this for you.
- If you pass in *extra* input fields not expected by the AppSync schema, this query will fail. You can see this in the `error` field returned by the query (the query itself does not throw, per GraphQL design).

#### Deleting an item
You can then delete the todo by using the delete mutation:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { DeleteTodoInput, DeleteTodoMutation } from './API';

const todoDetails: DeleteTodoInput = {
  id: 'some_id',
};

const deletedTodo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<DeleteTodoMutation>>({ 
  query: mutations.deleteTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const todoDetails = {
  id: 'some_id',
};

const deletedTodo = await API.graphql({ 
  query: mutations.deleteTodo, 
  variables: { input: todoDetails }
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="CLI">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify'
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations'

const result = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(deleteTodo, {
  input: {
    id: "<...>",
  }
}))
console.log(result)
```
The result output should indicate to you that the record was successfully deleted!

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Only an `id` is needed.

<Callout>
Join table records must be deleted prior to deleting the associated records. For example, for a many-to-many relationship between Posts and Tags, delete the PostTags join record prior to deleting a Post or Tag.
</Callout>

#### Troubleshooting

[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION to provide tips on how to avoid common errors such as: unauthorized errors and cross-platform gotchas. Each error should have a header with descriptive title to be included on a primary troubleshooting guide as well. Added Auth info from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/mutate-data.mdx - not sure if this one should be for troubleshooting or general info added outside the expander.)

##### Custom authorization mode

By default, each AppSync API will be set with a default authorization mode when you configure your app. If you would like to override the default authorization mode, you can do so by passing in an `authMode` property. The following examples show how you can mutate data with custom authorization mode:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import { GraphQLQuery, GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import { CreateTodoInput, CreateTodoMutation } from './API';

const todoDetails: CreateTodoInput = {
  id: 'some_id',
  name: 'My todo!',
  description: 'Hello world!'
};

const todo = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<CreateTodoMutation>>({
  query: mutations.createTodo,
  variables: { input: todoDetails },
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from "aws-amplify";
import { GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';

const todoDetails = {
  id: 'some_id',
  name: 'My todo!',
  description: 'Hello world!'
};

const todo = await API.graphql({
  query: mutations.createTodo,
  variables: { input: todoDetails },
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

### Cancel mutation requests

[comment]: # (Brief explanation on how canceling mutations works, what happens in the backend, and how to run the command – taken from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/cancel-request.mdx)

You may cancel any query or mutation request made through API category by keeping a reference to the promise returned.

```javascript
const promise = API.graphql(graphqlOperation(...));

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (API.isCancel(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
API.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `API.graphql()` has not been modified. Typically async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will not work

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return API.graphql(graphqlOperation(...));
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
API.cancel(promise, "my error message");
```

### Recap
At this point you implemented a few mutations to change your data. 

[comment]: # (ADD TO RECAP a tie-in to real-world use and application of the topic discussed OR reiterate the benefit.)


## Read application data
In this job, you will read application data using the Amplify GraphQL client. This will include understanding the differences between listing and getting data, how to filter this data, and how to paginate your data. We will also show you how to cancel these requests when needed.

> **Before you begin, you will need:**
> - Your application connected to the API
> - Populated data to query

### Read and filter your data
[comment]: # (Short explanation of the difference between listing and getting data.)
  
Queries are used to read data from the API and includes the list and get operations.
  
You can use both `List` and `Get` to query data in GraphQL. A `List` will get you a record of several items, such as Todo items and does not require an ID. This is best suited for getting an overview or summary or items or can help when filtering by a specific criteria across a list of items. When you want to query a single entry by ID then you would use `Get` to retrieve a specific Todo item.
  
#### Learn more about limitations and costs for specific operations
  
[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION that provides an overview of the cost of specific operations - e.g., list vs. get, queries, and scans; as well as limitations for specific functions - e.g., sorting, open search, items, and filters.

The Amplify CLI codegen automatically generates all possible GraphQL statements (mutations, queries, and subscriptions) and for JavaScript applications saves it in `src/graphql` folder

```javascript
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import * as mutations from './graphql/mutations';
import * as subscriptions from './graphql/subscriptions';
```

Running a GraphQL query is simple. Import the generated query and execute it with `API.graphql`:

<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';

// Simple query
const allTodos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>(
  { query: queries.listTodos }
);
console.log(allTodos); // result: { "data": { "listTodos": { "items": [/* ..... */] } } }

// Fetch a single record by its identifier

[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION to provide tips on how to avoid common errors such as: deny by default behavior with auth rules and the need for at least one auth rule. Each error should have a header with descriptive title to be included on a primary troubleshooting guide as well.)

##### Custom authorization mode

By default, each AppSync API will be set with a default authorization mode when you configure your app. If you would like to override the default authorization mode, you can do so by passing in an `authMode` property. For example, this is useful when you have public reads via API Key auth and authenticated reads via IAM auth. The following shows you how you can query data with custom authorization mode:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLQuery, GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';
import { GetTodoQuery } from './API';

const todos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<GetTodoQuery>>({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import * as queries from './graphql/queries';


const todos = await API.graphql({
  query: queries.listTodos,
  authMode: GRAPHQL_AUTH_MODE.AWS_IAM
});
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Paginate your data
  
[comment]: # (Description of how pagination works with the next token followed by the steps to paginate data manually or with UI hook. Content from - https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/query-data.mdx)
  
As your data grows, you will want to do pagination and filtering at the AppSync level instead of on the client. Fortunately, this is already built in to `API.graphql`, but you need to understand the schema of these queries. [This is explained in the AppSync docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/using-your-api.html), but here you will translate them to the `API.graphql` equivalent.

#### Benefits of pagination
[comment]: # (EXPANDER SECTION that provides more detail on how our pagination options differ and the benefits of each.)

You can find the input schemas in the Docs pane of the GraphQL explorer or inside your autogenerated `/graphql` folder. They look like this:

```graphql
listTodos(
  filter: ModelTodoFilterInput
  limit: Int
  nextToken: String): ModelTodoConnection

input ModelTodoFilterInput {
	id: ModelIDInput
	priority: ModelIntInput
	# ... all your other Todo fields here
	and: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	or: [ModelTodoFilterInput]
	not: ModelTodoFilterInput
}
```

#### Filtering Queries

Those input types in your schema indicate what kinds of filtering you can perform on them. For example, an integer field like `ModelIntInput` has this schema:

```graphql
input ModelIntInput {
  ne: Int # "not equal to"
  eq: Int # "equal to"
  le: Int # "less than or equal to"
  lt: Int # "less than"
  ge: Int # "greater than or equal to"
  gt: Int # "greater than"
  between: [Int]
  attributeExists: Boolean
  attributeType: ModelAttributeTypes
}
```

These vary based on the type of the field, but are linked to corresponding [DynamoDB queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Condition.html).

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
const variables = {
  filter: {
    priority: {
      eq: 1
    }
  }
};

await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});;
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

##### Compound Filters

You can combine filters with `and`, `or`, and `not` boolean logic. Observe, in the autogenerated schema above, that `ModelTodoFilterInput` is recursive in respect to those fields. So if, for example, you wanted to filter for `priority` values of 1 OR 2, you would do this:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  filter: {
    or: [
      { priority: { eq:1 } },
      { priority: { eq:2 } }
    ]
  }
};

await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
const variables = {
  filter: {
    or: [
      { priority: { eq:1 } },
      { priority: { eq:2 } }
    ]
  }
};

await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});;
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Note that querying for `priority` of 1 AND 2 would return no results, because this is boolean logic instead of natural language.

#### Paginating Queries

[comment]: # (This section was supplemented from - https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/query-data.mdx )

[question]: # (How much do we want to use from this guide which is 2 years old? https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/pages/guides/api-graphql/graphql-pagination/q/platform/%5Bplatform%5D.mdx – this content was not added to this page yet.)

Pagination in AppSync is done by making a request with a `limit`, and getting back a `nextToken` in order to get a cursor for the next page in your query:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { ListTodosQueryVariables, ListTodosQuery } from './API';

// Fetch first 20 records
const variables: ListTodosQueryVariables = {
  limit: 20, 
  // add filter as needed
};

const res = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data?.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables 
});

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data?.listTodos;
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
// Fetch first 20 records
const variables = {
  limit: 20, 
  // add filter as needed
};

const res = await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage1, nextToken } = res.data.listTodos;

// Fetch the next 20 records
variables.nextToken = nextToken;

const res = await API.graphql({ 
  query: listTodos, variables: variables
});

const { items: itemsPage2 } = res.data.listTodos;
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

A `nextToken` is a very long string that looks like `"eyJ2ZXJzaW9uejE1a2RPanZPQzFCMlFTdGNxdUFBQUJxekNDQWFjR0NTcUdTSWIzRFFFSEJxQ0NBWmd3Z2dHVUFnRUFNSUlCalFZSktvWklodmNOQVFjQk1CNEdDV0NHU0FGbEF3UUJMakFSQkF5eEtWQjUvTlJxS2o5ZHBYc0NBUkNBZ2dGZUZFNW1MbTRkb25BOUg0U0FpOGhSZ1lucmRndmQz"` which represents the cursor to the starting item of the next query made with these filters.

##### Frequently Asked Questions

- There is no API to get a total page count at this time. Note that scanning all items is a [potentially expensive operation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2901).
- Sorting is [available in DataStore](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/data-access/q/platform/js#predicates) but not in AppSync.
- AppSync schemas do not follow the edges/nodes of the [Relay spec](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification) but are spiritually similar.
- You [cannot query by `page` number](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/5086), you have to query by `nextToken`.

### Cancel read requests
  
[comment]: # (Brief explanation on how canceling read queries works, what happens in the backend, and how to run the command. We’ll want this section to work with the one above as this will be a fragment that will be reused – original from https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs/blob/main/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/js/cancel-request.mdx)
  
You may cancel any query or mutation request made through API category by keeping a reference to the promise returned.

```javascript
const promise = API.graphql(graphqlOperation(...));

try {
  await promise;
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
  // If the error is because the request was cancelled you can confirm here.
  if (API.isCancel(error)) {
    console.log(error.message); // "my message for cancellation"
    // handle user cancellation logic
  }
}

...

// To cancel the above request
API.cancel(promise, "my message for cancellation");
```

You need to ensure that the promise returned from `API.graphql()` has not been modified. Typically async functions wrap the promise being returned into another promise. For example, the following will not work

```javascript
async function makeAPICall() {
  return API.graphql(graphqlOperation(...));
}
const promise = makeAPICall();

// The following will NOT cancel the request.
API.cancel(promise, "my error message");
```

## Enable queries, mutations, and subscriptions

Now that the GraphQL API has deployed, it’s time to learn how to interact with it from a JavaScript client application. With GraphQL, you typically have the following types of operations:

- __Mutations__ - write data to the API (create, update, delete operations)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { CreateTodoInput, CreateTodoMutation, UpdateTodoMutation, DeleteTodoMutation } from './API';

const todo: CreateTodoInput = { name: "My first todo", description: "Hello world!" };

/* create a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<CreateTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {input: todo}));

/* update a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<UpdateTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(updateTodo, { input: { id: todoId, name: "Updated todo info" }}));

/* delete a todo */
await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<DeleteTodoMutation>>(graphqlOperation(deleteTodo, { input: { id: todoId }}));
```

</Block>
<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations';

const todo = { name: "My first todo", description: "Hello world!" };

/* create a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(createTodo, {input: todo}));

/* update a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(updateTodo, { input: { id: todoId, name: "Updated todo info" }}));

/* delete a todo */
await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(deleteTodo, { input: { id: todoId }}));
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

- __Queries__ - read data from the API (list, get operations)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLQuery } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';
import { ListTodosQuery } from './API';

const todos = await API.graphql<GraphQLQuery<ListTodosQuery>>(graphqlOperation(listTodos));
```

</Block>


<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { listTodos } from './graphql/queries';

const todos = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(listTodos));
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

- __Subscriptions__ - subscribe to changes in data for real-time functionality (onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete)

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="TypeScript">

```ts
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { GraphQLSubscription } from '@aws-amplify/api';
import { onCreateTodo } from './graphql/subscriptions';
import { OnCreateTodoSubscription } from './API';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const sub = API.graphql<GraphQLSubscription<OnCreateTodoSubscription>>(
    graphqlOperation(onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
    next: (payload) => {
      const createdTodo = payload.value.data?.onCreateTodo;
      console.log(createdTodo);
    }
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
sub.unsubscribe();
```

</Block>

<Block name="JavaScript">

```js
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
import { onCreateTodo } from './graphql/subscriptions';

// Subscribe to creation of Todo
const sub = API.graphql(
    graphqlOperation(onCreateTodo)
).subscribe({
    next: (payload) => {
      const createdTodo = payload.value.data?.onCreateTodo;
      console.log(createdTodo);
    }
});

// Stop receiving data updates from the subscription
sub.unsubscribe();
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Updating Your GraphQL Schema

When you create a GraphQL backend with the CLI, the schema definition for your backend data structure is saved in one of two places:

1. By default, schemas are saved in *amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/schema.graphql*. If the `schema.graphql` file exists, it will take precedence over option 2.
2. Optionally, schemas may be saved as a set of `.graphql` files stored in the *amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/schema/* directory. E.g. you might have files `Query.graphql`, `User.graphql`, and `Post.graphql`.

Once your API is deployed, updating the schema is easy with the CLI. You can edit the schema file(s) and run *amplify push* command to update your GraphQL backend.

For example, a sample GraphQL schema will look like this:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
}
```

Add a *priority* field to your Todo type:

```graphql
type Todo @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  priority: String
}
```

Save your schema file and update your GraphQL backend:

```bash
amplify push
```

When you run the *push* command, you will notice that your schema change is automatically detected, and your backend will be updated respectively.

```console
| Category | Resource name   | Operation | Provider plugin   |
| -------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Api      | myapi           | Update    | awscloudformation |
```

When the update is complete, you can see the changes to your backend by running the following command and select GraphQL option.

```bash
amplify api console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: (Use arrow keys)
❯ GraphQL
  REST
```

### Using GraphQL Transformers

As you can notice in the sample schema file above, the schema has a `@model` directive. The `@model` directive leverages a set of libraries that can help simplify the process of bootstrapping highly scalable, serverless GraphQL APIs on AWS. The `@model` directive tells the GraphQL Transform that you would like to store Todo objects in an Amazon DynamoDB table and configure CRUD operations for it. When you create or update your backend with *push* command, the CLI will automatically create and configure a new DynamoDB table that works with your AppSync API. The `@model` directive is just one of multiple transformers that can be used by annotating your *schema.graphql*.

The following directives are available to be used when defining your schema:  

| Directive | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [@model](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Object | Store objects in DynamoDB and configure CRUD resolvers. |
| [@auth](/cli/graphql/authorization-rules) on Object | Define authorization strategies for your API. |
| [@hasOne, @hasMany, @belongsTo, @manyToMany](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Field | Specify relationships between @model object types. |
| [@searchable](/cli/graphql/search-and-result-aggregations) on Object | Stream data of an @model object type to the Amazon OpenSearch Service. |
| [@primaryKey and @index](/cli/graphql/data-modeling) on Object | Index your data with keys. |
| [@function](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#lambda-function-resolver) on Field | Connect Lambda resolvers to your API. |
| [@predictions](/cli/graphql/connect-to-machine-learning-services/) on Field | Connect machine learning services. |
| [@http](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#http-resolver) on Field | Configure HTTP resolvers within your API. |

You may also write your own transformers to implement reproducible patterns that you find useful.

### Mocking and Local Testing

Amplify supports running a local mock server for testing your application with AWS AppSync, including debugging of resolvers, before pushing to the cloud. Please see the [CLI Toolchain documentation](/cli/usage/mock) for more details.

### Generate client types from a GraphQL schema

When working with GraphQL data it is useful to import types from your schema for type safety. You can do this with the Amplify CLI's automated code generation feature. The CLI automatically downloads GraphQL Introspection Schemas from the defined GraphQL endpoint and generates TypeScript or Flow classes for you. Every time you push your GraphQL API, the CLI will provide you the option to generate types and statements.

If you want to generate your GraphQL statements and types, run:

```bash
amplify codegen
```

A TypeScript or Flow type definition file will be generated in your target folder.  

### API configuration in the amplify folder

The Amplify CLI will create an `amplify/backend/api` folder that will hold the existing GraphQL schema, resolvers, and additional configuration around the API. To learn more about how the CLI manages this configuration, check out the documentation [here](/cli/graphql/overview). To learn how to configure custom GraphQL resolvers, check out the documentation [here](/cli/graphql/custom-business-logic#override-amplify-generated-resolvers).
