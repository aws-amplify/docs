## Run a mutation

Now that the client is set up, you can run a GraphQL mutation with `Amplify.API.mutate` to create, update, and delete your data.

import createTodo from "/src/fragments/lib/graphqlapi/flutter/getting-started/50_createtodo.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: createTodo}} />

To update the `Todo` with a new name:

```dart
final todoWithNewName = createdTodo.copyWith(name: 'new name');

final request = ModelMutations.update(todoWithNewName);
final response = await Amplify.API.mutate(request: request).response;
```

To delete the `Todo`:

```dart
final request = ModelMutations.delete(todoWithNewName);
final response = await Amplify.API.mutate(request: request).response;

// or delete by ID, ideal if you do not have the instance in memory, yet
final request = ModelMutations.deleteById(Todo.classType, '8e0dd2fc-2f4a-4dc4-b47f-2052eda10775');
final response = await Amplify.API.mutate(request: request).response;
```
