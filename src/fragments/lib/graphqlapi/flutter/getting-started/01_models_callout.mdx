Amplify Flutter does not currently support the use of data models when making GraphQL calls. To make a GraphQL request, you must provide a GraphQL query or mutation document, along with any runtime data needed to resolve variables in the document.

In the future, Amplify Flutter will provide APIs that generate GraphQL requests directly from Dart-language data models.

You can learn more about the structure of a request from the [GraphQL Query Language](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [AppSync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/graphql-overview.html) documentation. To test out a few of your own requests, open the AppSync console using `amplify console api` and navigate to the Queries tab.

We have created a [Github Issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/308) to track this missing feature.
