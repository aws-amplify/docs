The Storage and GraphQL API categories can be used together to associate a file, such as an image or video, with a particular record. For example, you might create a `User` model with a profile picture, or a `Post` model with an associated image. With Amplify's GraphQL API and Storage categories, you can reference the file within the model itself to create an association.

<Callout>

For more on the Amplify GraphQL API, see the [API documentation](/[platform]/prev/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-graphql-api/). For Storage, see [Storage documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/set-up-storage/). For Auth, see [Auth documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/set-up-auth/)

</Callout>

To get started, go to your project directory and run the command:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Choose the following when prompted:

```bash
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: `GraphQL`
? Choose the default authorization type for the API `Amazon Cognito User Pool`
 Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? `Default configuration`
 How do you want users to be able to sign in? `Username`
 Do you want to configure advanced settings? `No, I am done.`
? Here is the GraphQL API that we will create. Select a setting to edit or continue `Continue`
? Choose a schema template: `Blank Schema`
```

When prompted, use the following schema, which can also be found under `amplify/backend/api/[name of project]/schema.graphql`:

```graphql
type Song @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  coverArtKey: String # Set as optional to allow adding file after initial create
}
```

Add Storage with the command:

```bash
amplify add storage
```

Choose the following when prompted:

```bash
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: `Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)`
✔ Who should have access: `Auth users only`
✔ What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users? `create/update, read, delete`
✔ Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your S3 Bucket? (y/N) · `no`
```

Run `amplify push` to deploy the changes.

Once the backend has been provisioned, run `amplify codegen models` to generate the Swift model types for the app.

Next, add the Amplify(`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift.git`) package to your Xcode project and select the following modules to import when prompted:

- AWSAPIPlugin
- AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
- AWSS3StoragePlugin
- Amplify

Add the Authenticator from Amplify UI Authenticator for SwiftUI (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui-swift-authenticator.git`)

## Configuring authorization

Your application needs authorization credentials for reading and writing to both Storage and the GraphQL API, except in the case where all data and files are intended to be publicly accessible.

The Storage and API categories govern data access based on their own authorization patterns, meaning that it's necessary to configure appropriate auth roles for each individual category. Although both categories share the same access credentials set up through the Auth category, they work independently from one another. For instance, adding an `@auth` directive to the API schema does not guard against file access in the Storage category. Likewise, adding authorization rules to the Storage category does not guard against data access in the API category.

When you run `amplify add storage`, the CLI will configure appropriate IAM policies on the bucket using a Cognito Identity Pool role. You will then have the option of adding CRUD (Create, Update, Read and Delete) based permissions as well, so that Authenticated and Guest users will be granted limited permissions within these levels. **Even after adding this configuration via the CLI, all Storage access is still `public` by default.** To guard against accidental public access, the Storage access levels must either be configured globally in the configuration, or set within individual method calls. This guide uses the latter approach, setting Storage access to `private` per method call.

The ability to independently configure authorization rules for each category allows for more granular control over data access, and adds greater flexibility. For scenarios where authorization patterns must be mixed and matched, configure the access level on individual Storage method calls. For example, you may want to use `private` CRUD access on an individual Storage method call for files that should only be accessible by the owner (such as personal files), `protected` read access to allow all logged in users to view common files (such as images in a shared photo album), and `public` read access to allow all users to view a file (such as a public profile picture).

For more details on how to configure Storage authorization levels, see the [Storage documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/configure-access/). For more on configuring GraphQL API authorization, see the [API documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/customize-authorization-rules).

## Create a record with an associated file

First create a record via the GraphQL API, then upload the file to Storage, and finally add the association between the record and file. Use the following example with the GraphQL API and Storage categories to create a record and associate the file with the record.

<Callout>

Make sure that the file key used for Storage is unique. In this case, the API record's `id` is used as the file key for Storage to ensure uniqueness so that multiple API records will not be associated with the same file key unintentionally. However, this may not be true if the API record's `id` is customized to be a combination of two or more fields, or a different primary key field is used.

let song = Song(name: name)

guard let imageData = artCover.pngData() else {
    print("Could not get data from UIImage.")
    return
}

// Create the song record
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(song))
guard case .success(var createdSong) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return

// Upload the art cover image
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: createdSong.id,

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Add or update a file for an associated record

To associate a new or different file with the record, update the existing record with the file key. The following example uploads the file using Storage and updates the record with the file's key. If an image is already associated with the record, this will update the record with the new image.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Upload the new art image
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: currentSong.id,
                                         data: imageData,
                                         options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value

// Update the song record
currentSong.coverArtKey = currentSong.id
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(currentSong))
guard case .success(let updatedSong) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Query a record and retrieve the associated file

To retrieve the file associated with a record, first query the record, then use Storage to download the data to display an image:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Get the song record
let result = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id))
guard case .success(let queriedSong) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}
guard let song = queriedSong else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song with id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}

guard let coverArtKey = song.coverArtKey else {
    print("Song does not contain cover art")
    return
}

// Download the art cover
let imageData = try await Amplify.Storage.downloadData(key: coverArtKey,
                                                       options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value
let image = UIImage(data: imageData)
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

## Delete and remove files associated with API records

There are three common deletion workflows when working with Storage files and the GraphQL API:

1. Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record.
2. Remove the file association and delete the file.
3. Delete both file and record.

### Remove the file association, continue to persist both file and record

The following example removes the file association from the record, but does not delete the file from S3 or the record from the DynamoDB instance.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Get the song record
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id))
guard case .success(let queriedSong) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}
guard var song = queriedSong else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song by id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}
guard song.coverArtKey != nil else {
    print("There is no cover art key to remove image association")
    return
}

// Set the association to nil and update it
song.coverArtKey = nil
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(song))
guard case .success(let updatedSong) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Remove the file association and delete the file

The following example removes the file from the record, then deletes the file from S3:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift

let result = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id))
guard case .success(let queriedSong) = result else {

    return
}
guard var song = queriedSong else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song by id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}
guard let coverArtKey = song.coverArtKey else {
    print("There is no cover art key to remove image association")
    return
}

// Set the association to nil and update it
song.coverArtKey = nil
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(song))
guard case .success(let updatedSong) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}

// Remove the image
try await Amplify.Storage.remove(key: coverArtKey,
                                 options: .init(accessLevel: .private))
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Delete both file and record

The following example deletes the record from DynamoDB and then deletes the file from S3:

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Get the song record
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .get(Song.self, byIdentifier: currentSong.id))

    return
}
guard let song = queriedSong else {
    print("Song may have been deleted, no song by id: ", currentSong.id)
    return
}

if let coverArt = song.coverArtKey {
    // Remove the image
    try await Amplify.Storage.remove(key: coverArt,
                                     options: .init(accessLevel: .private))
}

// Delete the song record
let deleteResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .delete(song))
guard case .success = deleteResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", deleteResult)
    return
}
```

## Working with multiple files

You may want to add multiple files to a single record, such as a user profile with multiple images. To do this, you can add a list of file keys to the record. The following example adds a list of file keys to a record:

### GraphQL schema to associate a data model with multiple files

When prompted after running `amplify add api` use the following schema, which can also be found under `amplify/backend/api/[name of project]/schema.graphql`:

```graphql
type PhotoAlbum @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: public }]) {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  imageKeys: [String] #Set as optional to allow adding file(s) after initial create
}
```

CRUD operations when working with multiple files is the same as when working with a single file, with the exception that we are now working with a list of image keys, as opposed to a single image key.

### Create a record with multiple associated files

First create a record via the GraphQL API, then upload the files to Storage, and finally add the associations between the record and files.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Create the photo album record
let album = PhotoAlbum(name: name)
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(album))
guard case .success(var createdAlbum) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}

// Upload the photo album images
let imageKeys = await withTaskGroup(of: String?.self) { group in
    for imageData in imagesData {
        group.addTask {
            let key = "\(album.id)-\(UUID().uuidString)"
            do {
                _ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: key,
                                                         data: imageData,
                                                         options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value
                return key
            } catch {
                print("Failed with error:", error)
                return nil
            }
        }
    }

    var imageKeys: [String?] = []
    for await imageKey in group {
        imageKeys.append(imageKey)
    }
    return imageKeys.compactMap { $0 }
}

// Update the album with the image keys
createdAlbum.imageKeys = imageKeys
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(createdAlbum))
guard case .success(let updatedAlbum) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", updateResult)
    return
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Create a record with a single associated file

When a schema allows for multiple associated images, you can still create a record with a single associated file.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Create the photo album record
let album = PhotoAlbum(name: name)
let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(album))
guard case .success(var createdAlbum) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}

// Upload the photo album image
let key = "\(album.id)-\(UUID().uuidString)"
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: key,
                                         data: imageData,
                                         options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value

// Update the album with the image key
createdAlbum.imageKeys = [key]
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(createdAlbum))
guard case .success(let updatedAlbum) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", updateResult)
    return
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Add new files to an associated record

To associate additional files with a record, update the record with the keys returned by the Storage uploads.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Upload the new photo album image
let key = "\(currentAlbum.id)-\(UUID().uuidString)"
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: key,
                                          data: imageData,
                                          options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value

// Get the latest album
let result = try await Amplify.API.query(request: .get(PhotoAlbum.self, byIdentifier: currentAlbum.id))
guard case .success(let queriedAlbum) = result else {
    print("Failed with error: ", result)
    return
}
guard var album = queriedAlbum else {
    print("Album may have been deleted, no album with id: ", currentAlbum.id)
    return
}

guard var imageKeys = album.imageKeys else {
    print("Album does not contain images")
    return
}

// Add new to the existing keys
imageKeys.append(key)

// Update the album with the image keys
album.imageKeys = imageKeys
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(album))
guard case .success(let updatedAlbum) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", updateResult)
    return
}
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

### Update the file for an associated record

Updating a file for an associated record is the same as updating a file for a single file record, with the exception that you will need to update the list of file keys. The following replaces the last image in the album with a new image.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Swift">

```swift
// Upload the new photo album image
let key = "\(currentAlbum.id)-\(UUID().uuidString)"
_ = try await Amplify.Storage.uploadData(key: key,

                                         options: .init(accessLevel: .private)).value

// Update the album with the image keys
var album = currentAlbum
if var imageKeys = album.imageKeys {
    imageKeys.removeLast()
    imageKeys.append(key)
    album.imageKeys = imageKeys
} else {
    album.imageKeys = [key]
}
let updateResult = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(album))
guard case .success(let updatedAlbum) = updateResult else {
    print("Failed with error: ", updateResult)
    return
}
```

### Delete and remove files associated with API records

The workflow for deleting and removing files associated with API records is the same as when working with a single file, except that when performing a delete you will need to iterate over the list of files keys and call `Storage.remove()` for each file.

## Data consistency when working with records and files

The access patterns in this guide attempt to remove deleted files, but favor leaving orphans over leaving records that point to non-existent files. This optimizes for read latency by ensuring clients _rarely_ attempt to fetch a non-existent file from Storage. However, any app that deletes files can inherently cause records _on-device_ to point to non-existent files.

One example is when we [create an API record, associate the Storage file with that record](#create-a-record-with-an-associated-file). "Device A" calls the GraphQL API to create `API_Record_1`, and then associates that record with `First_Photo`. Later, when "Device A" is about to retrieve the file, "Device B" might query `API_Record_1`, delete `First_Photo`, and update the record accordingly. However, "Device A" is still using the old `API_Record_1`, which is now out-of-date. Even though the shared global state is correctly in sync at every stage, the individual device ("Device A") has an out-of-date record that points to a non-existent file. Similar issues can conceivably occur for updates. Depending on your app, some of these mismatches can be minimized _even more_ with [real-time data / GraphQL subscriptions](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/subscribe-data/).

It is important to understand when these mismatches can occur and to add meaningful error handling around these cases. This guide does not include exhaustive error handling, real-time subscriptions, re-querying of outdated records, or attempts to retry failed operations. However, these are all important considerations for a production-level application.
