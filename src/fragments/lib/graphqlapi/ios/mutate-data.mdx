## Run a mutation

Now that the client is set up, you can run a GraphQL mutation with `Amplify.API.mutate` to create, update, and delete your data.

Make sure you have the following imports at the top of your file:
```swift
import Amplify
import AWSPluginsCore
```

```swift
func updateTodo() async {
    // Retrieve your Todo using Amplify.API.query
    var todo = Todo(name: "my first todo", description: "todo description")
    todo.description = "updated description"
    do {
        let result = try await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .update(todo))
        switch result {
        case .success(let todo):
            print("Successfully created todo: \(todo)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
        }
    } catch (let error) {
        print("Got failed event with error \(error)")
    }
}
```

To create data, replace the request with `.create`
```swift
await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .create(todo))
```
To delete data, replace the request with `.delete`
```swift
await Amplify.API.mutate(request: .delete(todo))
```
