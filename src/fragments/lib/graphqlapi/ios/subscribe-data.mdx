Subscribe to mutations for creating real-time clients.

Because the lifetime of the subscription will last longer than the lifetime of a single function, you can create an instance variable at the top of your class:

```swift
var subscription: AmplifyAsyncThrowingSequence<GraphQLSubscriptionEvent<Todo>>?
```

```swift
func createSubscription() {
    subscription = Amplify.API.subscribe(request: .subscription(of: Todo.self, type: .onCreate))
    Task {
        do {
            for try await subscriptionEvent in subscription! {
                switch subscriptionEvent {
                case .connection(let subscriptionConnectionState):
                    print("Subscription connect state is \(subscriptionConnectionState)")
                case .data(let result):
                    switch result {
                    case .success(let createdTodo):
                        print("Successfully got todo from subscription: \(createdTodo)")
                    case .failure(let error):
                        print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch (let error) {
            print("Subscription has terminated with \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### Unsubscribing from updates

To unsubscribe from updates, you can call `cancel()` on the subscription:

```swift
func cancelSubscription() {
    // Cancel the subscription when you're finished with it
    subscription?.cancel()
}
```
