Subscribe to mutations for creating real-time clients.

Because the lifetime of the subscription will last longer than the lifetime of a single function, you can create an instance variable at the top of your class:

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Async/Await">

```swift
var subscription: AmplifyAsyncThrowingSequence<GraphQLSubscriptionEvent<Todo>>
```

</Block>

<Block name="Combine">

```swift
var subscription: AnyCancellable?
```

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

To listen to creation updates, you can use the following code sample:

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Async/Await">

```swift
func createSubscription() {
    subscription = Amplify.API.subscribe(request: .subscription(of: Todo.self, type: .onCreate))
    Task {
        do {
            for try await subscriptionEvent in subscription {
                switch subscriptionEvent {
                case .connection(let subscriptionConnectionState):
                    print("Subscription connect state is \(subscriptionConnectionState)")
                case .data(let result):
                    switch result {
                    case .success(let createdTodo):
                        print("Successfully got todo from subscription: \(createdTodo)")
                    case .failure(let error):
                        print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
                    }
                }
            }
        } catch {
            print("Subscription has terminated with \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```
</Block>

<Block name="Combine">

```swift
func createSubscription() {
    let sequence = Amplify.API.subscribe(request: .subscription(of: Todo.self, type: .onCreate))
    subscription = Amplify.Publisher.create(sequence)
        .sink {
        if case let .failure(apiError) = $0 {
            print("Subscription has terminated with \(apiError)")
        } else {
            print("Subscription has been closed successfully")
        }
    }
    receiveValue: { result in
        switch result {
            case .connection(let subscriptionConnectionState):
                print("Subscription connect state is \(subscriptionConnectionState)")
            case .data(let result):
                switch result {
                case .success(let createdTodo):
                    print("Successfully got todo from subscription: \(createdTodo)")
                case .failure(let error):
                    print("Got failed result with \(error.errorDescription)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

## Unsubscribing from updates

### Async/Await

To unsubscribe from updates, you can call `cancel()` on the subscription.

```swift
func cancelSubscription() {
    // Cancel the subscription listener when you're finished with it
    subscription?.cancel()
}
```

### Combine

Calling `cancel()` on the sequence will disconnect the subscription from the backend. Any downstream subscribers will also be cancelled.

```swift
let sequence = Amplify.API.subscribe(...)
let subscription = Amplify.Publisher.create(sequence)
let allUpdates = subscription.sink(...)
let filteredUpdates = subscription.filter{...}.sink(...)
sequence.cancel()   // sequence is now disconnected
                    // allUpdates and filteredUpdates will no longer receive data
```

Similarly, calling `cancel()` on the Combine subscriber (e.g., the `AnyCancellable` returned from `sink()`) will cause the underlying sequence to cancel. This will cause all attached subscribers to stop receiving updates.

```swift
allUpdates.cancel() // sequence is disconnected
                    // filteredUpdates will no longer receive data
```
