The Developer Preview of the Amplify Android Library is now exclusively using Kotlin and provides developers the ability to add cloud-based Auth, Storage, DataStore, and APIs to their apps. With this version, developers will be able to debug and contribute to the underlying open-source codebase completely in Kotlin.

This developer preview version of Amplify Android is layered on the [AWS SDK for Kotlin](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-kotlin), which was released as Developer Preview last year. This allows for access to the AWS SDK for Kotlin for a breadth of service-centric APIs.

You can also quickly get started by using our [Photo Sharing Sample App](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android-samples/tree/main/PhotoSharing).

We deeply appreciate your feedback on this Developer Preview as we work towards our General Availability launch: [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/discussions/categories/developer-preview) or [File a Bug Report](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android/issues/new/choose).
