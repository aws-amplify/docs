The Developer Preview of the Amplify iOS Library is now exclusively using Swift and provides developers the ability to add cloud-based Auth, Storage, Data, and APIs to their apps. With this version, Swift developers will be able to debug and contribute to the underlying open-source codebase completely in Swift. We plan to incrementally add more Amplify features including Swift-based language features like structured concurrency.

This developer preview version of Amplify iOS is layered on the [AWS SDK for Swift](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift), which was released as Developer Preview last year. This allows for access to the AWS SDK for Swift for a breadth of service-centric APIs.

You can also quickly get started by using our [Photo Sharing Sample App](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios-samples/tree/dev-preview).

We deeply appreciate your feedback on this Developer Preview as we work towards our General Availability launch: [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/discussions/categories/developer-preview) or [File a Bug Report](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios/issues/new/choose).
