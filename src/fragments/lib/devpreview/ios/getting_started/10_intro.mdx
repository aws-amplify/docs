The Developer Preview of the Amplify iOS Library is now exclusively using Swift and provides developers the ability to add cloud-based Auth, Storage, Data, and APIs to their apps. With this version, Swift developers will be able to debug and contribute to the underlying open-source codebase completely in Swift. We plan to incrementally add more Amplify features including Swift-based language features like structured concurrency.

This developer preview version of Amplify iOS is layered on the [AWS SDK for Swift](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-swift), which was released as Developer Preview last year. This allows for access to the AWS SDK for Swift for a breadth of service-centric APIs.
