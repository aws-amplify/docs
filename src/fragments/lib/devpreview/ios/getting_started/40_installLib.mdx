To start adding the Amplify Libraries to your iOS project, open your project in Xcode and select **File > Add Packages...**

![Add package dependency](/images/project-setup/20_4_add-package-dependency.png)

Enter the Amplify iOS GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios`) into the search bar and wait for the result to load.

You'll see the Amplify iOS repository rules for which version of Amplify you want Swift Package Manager to install. Choose the dependency rule **Branch** and enter **dev-preview** as the branch name, then click **Add Package**.

Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. Always select the **Amplify** library. The "Plugin" to install depends on which categories you are using:

- API: **AWSAPIPlugin**
- Auth: **AWSCognitoAuthPlugin**
- DataStore: **AWSDataStorePlugin**
- Storage: **AWSS3StoragePlugin**

Select all that are appropriate, then click **Add Package**.

You can always go back and modify which SPM packages are included in your project by opening the Package Dependencies tab for your project: Click on the Project file in the Xcode navigator, then click on your project's icon, then select the **Package Dependencies** tab.

You must explicitly import plugins in your app code when using Swift Package Manager to install Amplify, as in:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSAPIPlugin
import AWSDataStorePlugin
```

This is a result of Swift Package Manager's importing only relevant pieces of the dependency being installed–in this case, the categories of Amplify.
