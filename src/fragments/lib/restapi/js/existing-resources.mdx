Existing Amazon API Gateway resources can be used with the Amplify Libraries by calling `Amplify.configure()` with the API Gateway API name and options. Note you need to supply the full resource configuration and library options objects when calling `Amplify.configure()`. The following example shows how to configure additional API Gateway resources to an existing Amplify application:

```javascript
const existingConfig = Amplify.getConfig();
Amplify.configure({
  ...existingConfig,
  API: {
    ...existingConfig.API,
    REST: {
      ...existingConfig.API?.REST,
      '[API NAME]': {
        endpoint: '[API GATEWAY ENDPOINT]',
        region: '[REGION]'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

- **API NAME**: Friendly name for the API (e.g., _api_)
  - **endpoint**: The HTTPS endpoint of the API (e.g. _https://aaaaaaaaaa.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api_)
  - **region**: AWS Region where the resources are provisioned (e.g. _us-east-1_). If not specified, the region will be inferred from the endpoint.

Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](/lib/project-setup/create-application#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
