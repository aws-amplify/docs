To invoke an endpoint, you need to set input object with required `apiName` 
option and optional `headers`, `queryParams`, and `body` options. API status
code response > 299 are thrown as an `RestApiError` instance. The error instance
provides `name` and `message` properties parsed from the response.

## GET requests

```javascript
import { get } from 'aws-amplify/api';

async function getTodo() {
  try {
    const restOperation = get({ 
      apiName: 'todo-api',
      path: '/todo' 
    });
    const response = await restOperation.response;
    console.log('GET call succeeded: ', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('GET call failed: ', error);
  }
}
```

## Accessing query parameters & body in Lambda proxy function

> To learn more about Lambda Proxy Integration, please visit [Amazon API Gateway Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html).

If you are using a REST API which is generated with Amplify CLI, your backend is created with Lambda Proxy Integration, and you can access your query parameters & body within your Lambda function via the _event_ object:

```javascript
exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
  console.log(event.queryStringParameters);
  console.log('body: ', event.body);
};
```

Alternatively, you can update your backend file which is located at `amplify/backend/function/[your-lambda-function]/app.js` with the middleware:

```javascript
const awsServerlessExpressMiddleware = require('aws-serverless-express/middleware');
app.use(awsServerlessExpressMiddleware.eventContext());
```

Accessing Query Parameters with Serverless Express

In your request handler use `req.apiGateway.event` or `req.query`:

```javascript
app.get('/items', function(req, res) {
  const query = req.query;
  // or
  // const query = req.apiGateway.event.queryStringParameters
  res.json({
    event: req.apiGateway.event, // to view all event data
    query: query
  });
});
```

Then you can use query parameters in your path as follows:

```javascript
async function getTodo() {
  try {
    const restOperation = get({
      apiName: 'todo-api',
      path: '/todo',
      options: {
        queryParams: {
          id: '123'
        }
      }
    });
    const response = await restOperation.response;
    console.log('GET call succeeded: ', response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('GET call failed: ', error);
  }
}
```

## Accessing response payload

You can consume the response payload by accessing the `body` property of the response object.
Depending on the use case and the content type of the body, you can consume they payload in string, blob or JSON.

```javascript
// ...
const { body } = await restOperation.response;
// consume as a string:
const str = await body.text();
// OR consume as a blob:
const blob = await body.blob();
// OR consume as a JSON:
const json = await body.json();
```

You can not consume the response payload more than once.
