Use the package manager of your choice to install the amplify JS library. For example, with `npm`:

import rnVersionCallout from '/src/fragments/common/react-native-version-deployment-target.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: rnVersionCallout }} />

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/react-native
```

If you are using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn add aws-amplify @aws-amplify/react-native
```
