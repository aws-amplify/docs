To initialize the Amplify API category you need to configure Amplify with `Amplify.configure()`.

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `index.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the [Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/library-not-configured/) for possible causes of this issue.
