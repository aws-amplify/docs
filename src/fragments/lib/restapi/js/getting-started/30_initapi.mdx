To initialize the Amplify API category you need to configure Amplify with `Amplify.configure()`.

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `index.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```

<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your Application. If you are running into the `Library Not Configured` error and are unsure why, check out our [Troubleshooting documentation](/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/library-not-configured/) on this issue.
