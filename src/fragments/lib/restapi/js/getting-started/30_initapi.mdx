To initialize the Amplify API category you need to configure Amplify with `Amplify.configure()`.

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `index.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```
