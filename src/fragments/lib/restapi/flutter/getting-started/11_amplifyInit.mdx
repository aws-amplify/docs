To start provisioning API resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add api
```

Enter the following when prompted:
```console

    `/todo`
? Choose a Lambda source 
    `Create a new Lambda function`
? Provide a friendly name for your resource to be used as a label for this category in the project:

To push your changes to the cloud, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.dart` should be updated to reference provisioned backend storage resources.  Note that this file should already be a part of your project if you followed the [Project setup walkthrough](/[platform]/start/project-setup/create-application/).
