## DELETE requests

```dart
try {
    RestOptions options = RestOptions(
        path: '/todo'
    );
    RestOperation restOperation = Amplify.API.delete(
        restOptions: options
    );
    RestResponse response = await restOperation.response
    print('DELETE call succeeded'); 
    print(new String.fromCharCodes(response.data));
} on ApiException catch (e) {
    print('DELETE call failed: $e');
}
```
