Expand **Gradle Scripts**, open **build.gradle (Module :app)**. You will already have configured Amplify by following the steps in the [Project Setup walkthrough](/lib/project-setup/create-application).

Add API by adding these libraries into the `dependencies` block:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-api:ANDROID_VERSION'
    implementation 'com.amplifyframework:aws-auth-cognito:ANDROID_VERSION'

}
```
