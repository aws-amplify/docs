The Amplify CLI deploys REST APIs and handlers using [Amazon API Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/) and [AWS Lambda](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/).

The API category will perform SDK code generation which, when used with the `AWSMobileClient` can be used for creating signed requests for Amazon API Gateway when the service Authorization is set to `AWS_IAM` or when using a [Cognito User Pools Authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html).

## Create new REST API

In a terminal window, navigate to your project folder (the folder that contains your app `.xcodeproj` file), and add the SDK to your app.

```console
cd ./YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER
amplify add api
```

When prompted select the following options:

```console
> REST
> Create a new Lambda function
> Serverless express function
> Restrict API access? Yes
> Who should have access? Authenticated and Guest users
```

When configuration of your API is complete, the CLI displays a message confirming that you have configured local CLI metadata for this category. You can confirm this by running `amplify status`. Finally deploy your changes to the cloud:

```bash
amplify push
```

## Connect to Your Backend

Add `AWSAPIPlugin` to your Podfile:

```ruby
target :'YOUR-APP-NAME' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'Amplify'
  pod 'AWSPluginsCore'
  pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSAPIPlugin'
end
```

Run `pod install --repo-update` and then add `awsconfiguration.json` and `amplifyconfiguration.json` file to your project **(File->Add Files to ..->Add)** and then build your project, ensuring there are no issues.

Add the following code to your app:

```swift                                
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    // Override point for customization after application launch.
    AWSMobileClient.default().initialize { (userState, error) in
        guard error == nil else {
            print("Error initializing AWSMobileClient. Error: \(error!.localizedDescription)")
            return
        }
        guard let userState = userState else {
            print("userState is unexpectedly empty initializing AWSMobileClient")
            return
        }

        print("AWSMobileClient initialized, userstate: \(userState)")
    }

    // Amplify section
    let apiPlugin = AWSAPIPlugin()
    try! Amplify.add(plugin: apiPlugin)
    try! Amplify.configure()
    print("Amplify initialized")

    return true
}
```

## IAM authorization

To invoke an API Gateway endpoint from your application, For AWS IAM authorization use the `AWSMobileClient` as outlined in the authentication section.

**Update this to have authorization mode included here rather than link**
