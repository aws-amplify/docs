To initialize the Amplify API and Authentication categories, you are required to use the `Amplify.addPlugin()` method for each category you want.  When you are done calling `addPlugin()` on each category, you finish configuring Amplify by calling `Amplify.configure()`.

<Block name="SwiftUI">

In your `App` scene, configure Amplify in the initializer:

```swift
@main
struct MyAmplifyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }

    init() {
        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSAPIPlugin())
            try Amplify.configure()
            print("Amplify configured with API and Auth plugin")
        } catch {
            print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="UIKit">

Add the following imports to the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` file:
```swift
import Amplify
import AWSAPIPlugin
```

Add the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {

    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSAPIPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with API and Auth plugin")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

</Block>

Upon building and running this application you should see the following in your console window:

```console
Amplify configured with API and Auth plugin
```
