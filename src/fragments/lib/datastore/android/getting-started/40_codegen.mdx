If you have chosen to use the `amplify-tools-gradle-plugin` Gradle plugin, we will now use it to generate the models from the schema defined in `schema.graphql` and automatically add the new files to the project. If you have chosen to use the Amplify CLI instead, please skip this section, and follow the [Code generation: Amplify CLI](#code-generation-amplify-cli) section.

1. **Select modelgen in the run/configuration menu**
2. **Run the modelgen task by clicking on the green arrow**. Running the task will invoke the Amplify tools script to generate the model files, and automatically add them to your project.

Once the task is complete, a new directory should be added to your project at `app/src/main/java/com/amplifyframework/datastore/generated/model`. It should contain the following files:

  - `AmplifyModelProvider.java`
  - `Todo.java`
