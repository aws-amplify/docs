## Configure Multiple Authorization Types

For some use cases, you will want DataStore to use multiple authorization types. For example, an app might use `API Key` for public content and `Cognito User Pool` for personalized content once the user logs in.

By default, DataStore uses your API's default authorization type listed in `aws_appsync_authenticationType` in your Amplify configuration. To change the default authorization type, run `amplify update api`. Every network request sent through DataStore uses that authorization type, regardless of the model's `@auth` rule. 

To enable DataStore to use multiple authorization types based on the model's `@auth` rules, add `authModeStrategyType: AuthModeStrategyType.MULTI_AUTH` to your Amplify configuration:

```js
import Amplify, { AuthModeStrategyType } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports'; 

Amplify.configure({
  ...awsconfig,
  DataStore: {
    authModeStrategyType: AuthModeStrategyType.MULTI_AUTH
  }
})
```

This configuration enables DataStore to synchronize data using the model's `@auth` rule provider for each model.

### Multiple authorization types priority order

If there are multiple `@auth` rules on a model, the rules will be ranked by priority (see below), and DataStore will attempt the synchronization with each authorization type until one succeeds (or they all fail).

| Priority | `allow`: AuthStrategy | `provider` |
|:----------|:-----:|:------:|
| 1 | `owner` | `userPools` |
| 2 | `owner` | `oidc` |
| 3 | `group` | `userPools` |
| 4 | `group` | `oidc` |
| 5 | `private` | `userPools` |
| 6 | `private` | `iam` |
| 7 | `public` | `iam` |
| 8 | `public` | `apiKey` |

If there is **not** an authenticated user session, DataStore will only attempt `public` rules.

As a fallback, if there are no valid rules for a model, DataStore will attempt synchronization with the default authorization type.

####  Example with multiple authorization types

```graphql
type YourModel
  @model
  @auth(
		rules: [
			{ allow: owner }
			{ allow: public, provider: apiKey, operations: [read] }
		]
	) {
  ...
}
```
DataStore will attempt to use owner-based authorization first when synchronizing data if there is an authenticated user. If that request fails for some reason, DataStore will attempt the request again with public authorization. If there is **no** authenticated user, public authorization will be used.
