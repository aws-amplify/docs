```js
const subscription = DataStore.observeQuery(Post).subscribe(snapshot => {
  const { items, isSynced } = snapshot;
  // update the UI, display the 'synced' status, etc.
});
```

### Predicates

The `observeQuery` method accepts the same predicates which can be passed to the `query` and `observe` methods.

For example, if you wanted to simultaneously query and observe changes to a list of all `Post` Models which have a status of `'PUBLISHED'`:

```js
const subscription = DataStore.observeQuery(
  Post,
  p => p.status("eq", "PUBLISHED")
).subscribe(snapshot => {
  const { items, isSynced } = snapshot;
  console.log({items, isSynced});
});
```

### Sorting

Items returned in `observeQuery` snapshots can also be sorted by one or more fields.

For example, to sort all Post objects by rating in ascending order and title in descending order:

```js
const subscription = DataStore.observeQuery(
  Post,
  Predicates.ALL,
  {
    sort: s => s.rating(SortDirection.ASCENDING).title(SortDirection.DESCENDING)
  }
).subscribe(snapshot => {
  const { items, isSynced } = snapshot;
  console.log({items, isSynced});
});
```

### Canceling observeQuery & closing a subscription

The subscription will continue to send snapshots of accumulated data until the sync process is complete, though the subscription can be cancelled at any time.

For example, in a React app, the subscription could be canceled when the component unmounts.

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// store the Observable in state, to unsubscribe later
const [postSubscription, setPostSubscription] = useState();

useEffect(() => {
  let subscription = DataStore.observeQuery(
    Post,
    Predicates.ALL
  ).subscribe(snapshot => {
    const { items, isSynced } = snapshot;
    console.log({items, isSynced});
  });

  setPostSubscription(subscription);

  // called when the component unmounts
  return () => {
    postSubscription.unsubscribe();
  }
}, [postSubscription]);
```

<Callout>

The `observeQuery` function is asynchronous; however, you should not use `await` like the other DataStore API methods since it is a long running task and you should make it non-blocking (i.e. code after the `DataStore.observeQuery()` call should not wait for its execution to finish).

</Callout>

<Callout>

`DataStore.clear()` will remove any active subscriptions. You'll need to re-establish them manually by calling `DataStore.observeQuery()` again after you clear.

</Callout>

<Callout>

The default configuration for `observeQuery` has a default `syncPageSize` of 1,000 and a default `maxRecordsToSync` of 10,000. These values can be customized by configuring their values manually in `DataStore.configure`:

</Callout>

```
DataStore.configure({
    syncPageSize: 500
    maxRecordsToSync: 5000
});
```

<Callout warning>

`DataStore.configure()` should only by called once at the root of your app.

</Callout>
