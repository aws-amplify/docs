When using multiple conditions, there is an implicit `and` defined to mirror the [GraphQL Transformer condition statements](/cli/graphql/data-modeling). For example with multiple conditions:

```js
const posts = await DataStore.query(Post, (c) => c.and(c => [
  c.rating.gt(4),
  c.status.eq(PostStatus.ACTIVE)
]));
```
