## Clear

To clear local data from DataStore, use the `clear` method:

```js
import { DataStore } from 'aws-amplify';

await DataStore.clear();
```

<Callout>

If your app is has authentication implemented, it is recommended to call `DataStore.clear()` on signin/signout to remove any user-specific data. This method is often important to use for shared device scenarios or where you need to purge the local on-device storage of records for security/privacy concerns.

## Start

To manually start the sync process, use the `start` method:

```js
import { DataStore } from 'aws-amplify';

await DataStore.start();
```

Synchronization starts automatically whenever you run `DataStore.query()` however you can explicitly begin the process with `DataStore.start()`.
