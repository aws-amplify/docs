<Callout>

An initial `networkStatus` event is always dispatched, in which `active` is set to `false`. Shortly thereafter, you will receive an updated event that reflects the true status of the network connectivity.

You may want to setup your Hub Listener or Subscriber before calling `Amplify.configure()`, otherwise you may miss some of the `DataStore` events that are emitted.
