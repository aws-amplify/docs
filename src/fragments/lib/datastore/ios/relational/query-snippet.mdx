Models with one-to-many connections are lazy-loaded when accessing the connected property, so accessing a relation is as simple as:

<Block name="Async/Await">

```swift
do {
    let savedPost = try await Amplify.DataStore.save(postWithComments)
    print("Post with Comment saved! \(savedPost)")
    guard let comments = savedPost.comments else {
        return
    }
    // call fetch to lazy load the postResult before accessing its result
    try await comments.fetch()
    for comment in comments {
        print(comment.content)
    }
} catch let error as DataStoreError {
    print("Failed to save \(error)")
} catch let coreError as CoreError {
    print("Failed to fetch \(error)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error \(error)")
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="Combine">

```swift
let sink = Amplify.Publisher.create(try await Amplify.DataStore.query(Post.self, byId: "123"))
    .compactMap { $0?.comments }
    .flatMap { $0.loadAsPublisher() }
    .sink {
        if case let .failure(error) = $0 {
            print("Error retrieving post \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
    receiveValue: {
        Task {
            do {
                try await $0.fetch()
                for comment in $0 {
                    print(comment.content)
                }
            } catch let error as CoreError {
                print("Failed with fetch \(error)")
            } catch {
                print("Unexpected error \(error)")
            }
        }
        
    }
```

The connected properties are of type `List<M>`, where `M` is the model type, and that type is a custom [Swift Collection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/collection), which means that you can `filter`, `map`, etc:

```swift
let excitedComments = postWithComments
    .comments?
    .compactMap { $0.content }
    .filter { $0.contains("Wow!") }
```
