### Add the API plugin

Although DataStore presents a distinct API, its cloud synchronization functionality relies on the underlying [API category](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/set-up-data/). Therefore, you will still be required to incorporate the API plugin when working with DataStore.

Add `AWSAPIPlugin` in your Amplify initialization code alongside with the previously added `AWSDataStorePlugin`.

```swift
try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSAPIPlugin())
```
