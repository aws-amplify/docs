## Example schema

The following schema is an example of a model named `Todo` that uses the `@auth` directive.

```graphql
type Todo
    @model
    @auth(rules: [
        { allow: owner, ownerField: "owner", operations: [create, update, delete] },
    ]) {
    id: ID!
    content: String!
    owner: String
}
```

By setting `allow:owner` with `operations` set to `create`, `update` and `delete`, you have effectively set permissions for both the user who created the model (owner) and everyone else (non-owners). For owners this means, they can update and delete their created instances. For non-owners, this means they can read instances that are not owned by them and are restricted from updating or deleting them.

For example, if there are two users, UserA and UserB, where UserA creates a `Todo` instance named `todo123`, UserA can create, update, or delete `todo123`. UserB can read `todo123` but can not update or delete `todo123`.

The `@auth` directive when used with Amplify DataStore supports the following fields:

  - `allow` with "owner" and "groups"
  - `ownerField`
  - `groups`
  - `operations`

## Configure API with Amazon Cognito user pool

While using the `@auth` directive in your schema to limit read/write access, you require authentication to be integrated into your app in order to differentiate who the owner is. To set this up issue the command:

```console
amplify update api
```

then follow the prompts:

```console
? Please select from one of the below mentioned services: 
  `GraphQL`
? Select from the options below 
  `Update auth settings`
? Choose the default authorization type for the API 
  `Amazon Cognito User Pool`
```

Once finished, run `amplify push` to provision your services in the backend.

## Configuration

Upon successfully running `amplify push` per the last step, `amplifyconfiguration.json` will have a section under "awsAPIPlugins" and "awsCognitoAuthPlugin" with the corresponding API and Auth configurations. Your `amplifyconfiguration.json` may look like this:

```json
{
    "api": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsAPIPlugin": {
                // ...
            }
        }
    },
    "auth": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsCognitoAuthPlugin": {
                // ...
            }
        }
    }
```

Add "AWSCognitoAuthPlugin" and "AWSAPIPlugin" to Amplify before configuring

```swift
try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSAPIPlugin())
try Amplify.configure()
```

## Authentication requirements

In order to issue an operation (`DataStore.save`, `DataStore.delete`) on a model that has fine grain controls defined, the user must be signed in using `Amplify.Auth.signIn`. A user's sign-in state may vary during the lifecycle of an app, so it is a common practice to check if the user has already been signed in by using `Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession` prior to attempting to update/delete a model that uses the @auth directive. The following are examples of how we recommend you handle auth state in your application:

1. User's sign in state is known to be signed out, and the user needs to sign in, prior to making a call to `DataStore.save()`. 

```swift
do {
    let signInResult = try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(username: username, password: password)
    if signInResult.isSignedIn {
        print("Sign in succeeded")
    }
    // Amplify.DataStore.save
} catch let error as AuthError {
    print("Sign in error \(error)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error \(error)")
}
```

2. User's sign in state is unknown (for example, app was terminated or transitioned from background to foreground) and you need to check prior to making a call to `DataStore.save()`. 

```swift
do {
    let session = try await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession() 
    print("Is user signed in - \(session.isSignedIn)")
    // try await Amplify.DataStore.save
} catch let error as AuthError {
    print("failed to get auth session \(error)")
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error \(error)")
}
```

3. During the lifecycle of the app, listen to Auth events to show different views based on the user's state. See [Auth Events](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/auth-events/) for more details.

- [Auth.fetchAuthSession](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/set-up-auth/#check-the-current-auth-session)
- [Auth Events](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/auth-events/)

## Model owner

To check who the owner of the model is, call `DataStore.query` and check the user's username against the owner field. 
```swift
if let currentUser = try await Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser() {
    if currentUser.username == todo.owner {
        print("This todo was created by the current user")
    }
}
```

If you attempt to call `DataStore.save` or `DataStore.delete` on a model that is not owned by the user, then a `conditionalSaveFailed` event will be emitted with the `MutationEvent` for you to immediately retrieve the current state of the model.

```swift
_ = Amplify.Hub.listen(to: .dataStore) { payload in
    if payload.eventName == HubPayload.EventName.DataStore.conditionalSaveFailed {
        if let mutationEvent = payload.data as? MutationEvent {
            let modelName = mutationEvent.modelName
            let id = mutationEvent.modelId
            if modelName == YourModel.modelName {
                // try await Amplify.DataStore.query(YourModel.self, byId: id)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
