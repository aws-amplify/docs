DataStore has the capability to handle relationships between Models, such as *has one*, *has many*, *belongs to*. In GraphQL this is done with the `@connection` and `@key` directives as defined in the [GraphQL Transformer documentation](/cli/graphql-transformer/connection).

<Callout warning>

When using the `@key` directive with DataStore, as long as you specify a `name` you can use any value(s) in `fields`. However, if the `name` property is omitted, the first item in the `fields` array must be `"id"`. E.g., `@key(fields: ["id", "content"])`.

## Updated schema

import js0 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/relational/updated-schema.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js0}} />

import ios1 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/relational/updated-schema.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios1}} />

import android2 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/relational/updated-schema.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android2}} />

import flutter3 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/relational/updated-schema.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter3}} />

## Saving relations

In order to save connected models you will create an instance of the model you wish to connect and pass it's ID to `DataStore.save`:

import js4 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/relational/save-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js4}} />

import ios5 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/relational/save-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios5}} />

import android6 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/relational/save-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android6}} />

import flutter7 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/relational/save-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter7}} />

## Querying relations

import js8 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/relational/query-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js8}} />

import ios9 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/relational/query-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios9}} />

import android10 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/relational/query-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android10}} />

import flutter11 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/relational/query-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter11}} />

## Deleting relations

When you delete a parent object in a one to many relationship, the children will also be removed from the DataStore and mutations for this deletion will be sent over the network. For example the following operation would remove the Post with id *123* as well as any related comments:

import js12 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/relational/delete-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js12}} />

import ios13 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/relational/delete-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios13}} />

import android14 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/relational/delete-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android14}} />

import flutter15 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/relational/delete-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter15}} />

However, in a many to many relationship the children are not removed and you must explicitly delete them.

### Many-to-many

The above example shows how to use a *one-to-many* schema and save connected models. You can also define *many-to-many* relationships, such as the relationship shown in the [@connection examples](/cli/graphql-transformer/connection#many-to-many-connections).

For many-to-many relationships, you save instances of models from each side of the relationship and then join them together by connecting type on a field defined with `@connection`. Consider the following schema:

```graphql
enum PostStatus {
  ACTIVE
  INACTIVE
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  rating: Int
  status: PostStatus
  editors: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byPost", fields: ["id"])
}

type PostEditor
  @model(queries: null)
  @key(name: "byPost", fields: ["postID", "editorID"])
  @key(name: "byEditor", fields: ["editorID", "postID"]) {
  id: ID!
  postID: ID!
  editorID: ID!
  post: Post! @connection(fields: ["postID"])
  editor: User! @connection(fields: ["editorID"])
}

type User @model {
  id: ID!
  username: String!
  posts: [PostEditor] @connection(keyName: "byEditor", fields: ["id"])
}
```
