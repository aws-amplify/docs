## Observe model mutations in real-time

You can subscribe to changes on your Models. This reacts dynamically to updates of data to the underlying Storage Engine, which could be the result of GraphQL Subscriptions as well as Queries or Mutations that run against the backing AppSync API if you are synchronizing with the cloud.

## Observe query results in real-time

`observeQuery(...)` returns an initial data set, similar to `query(...)` and also automatically subscribes to subsequent changes to the query. This allows you to show your customers some initial data first as your app data is syncing. Recommended for large data sets in particular.

The first snapshot returned from `observeQuery` will contain the same results as calling `query` directly on your Model - a collection of all the locally-available records. Subsequent snapshots will contain all of the `items` synced so far and will continue sending snapshots until `isSynced` is `true`.

`observeQuery` also accepts the same predicates and sorting options as `query`.
