## Observe Data in real-time

You can subscribe to changes on your Models. This reacts dynamically to updates of data to the underlying Storage Engine, which could be the result of GraphQL Subscriptions as well as Queries or Mutations that run against the backing AppSync API if you are synchronizing with the cloud.

import js0 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/real-time/observe-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js0}} />

import ios1 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/real-time/observe-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios1}} />

import android2 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/real-time/observe-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android2}} />

import flutter3 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/real-time/observe-snippet.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter3}} />

## Displaying Data during the Sync process with observeQuery

### Overview

For larger data sets, the sync process can take some time to complete when loading the app for the first time.

If you want to display data as it is syncing from the cloud (and, conveniently, observe any subsequent changes to the selection set) you can use the `observeQuery` method to:

- display data during the sync process
- check for the `isSynced` status (`true` when the local store reflects the data in DynamoDB)
- observe changes to the Model after the sync process is complete

<Callout>

The default configuration for `observeQuery` has a default `syncPageSize` of 1,000 and a default `maxRecordsToSync` of 10,000. These values can be customized by configuring their values manually in `DataStore.configure`:

</Callout>

```
DataStore.configure({
    syncPageSize: 500
    maxRecordsToSync: 5000
});
```

<Callout warning>

`DataStore.configure()` should only by called once at the root of your app.

</Callout>

### Primary Usage

The first snapshot returned from observe query will contain the same results as calling `query` directly on your Model - a collection of all the locally-available records. Subsequent snapshots will contain all of the `items` synced so far and will continue sending snapshots until `isSynced` is `true`.

`observeQuery` still reacts dynamically to updates of data after the sync process is complete, sending a singular snapshot for every change occurring to the observed Model (just as `observe` does) as long as the subscription is maintained.
