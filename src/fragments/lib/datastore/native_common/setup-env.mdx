In order to setup your local development environment, you have two options.

### Option 1: Platform integration

import js1 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/js/getting-started/30_platformIntegration.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{js: js1}} />

import android2 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/getting-started/30_platformIntegration.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android2}} />

import flutter3 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/getting-started/30_platformIntegration.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter3}} />

### Option 2: Use Amplify CLI

Instead of using the platform integration, you can alternatively use the Amplify CLI on its own. This option is particularly **useful for existing projects** where Amplify is already configured and you want to add DataStore to it.

import all0 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/native_common/setup-env-cli.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{all: all0}} />
