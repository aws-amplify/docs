## Clear

To clear local data from DataStore, use the `clear` method:

import ios0 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/other-methods/10_clear.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios0}} />

import android1 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/other-methods/10_clear.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android1}} />

import flutter1 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/other-methods/10_clear.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter1}} />

<Callout>

If your app uses authentication, it is recommended to call `DataStore.clear()` on sign-in or sign-out to remove any user-specific data. In scenarios where a mobile device can be shared by several users, calling `DataStore.clear()` will ensure that data does not leak from one user to another.

## Start

import ios2 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/other-methods/15_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios2}} />

import android3 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/other-methods/15_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android3}} />

import flutter2 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/other-methods/15_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter2}} />


import ios4 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/other-methods/20_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios4}} />

import android5 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/other-methods/20_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android5}} />

import flutter3 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/other-methods/20_start.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter3}} />

## Stop

To stop the DataStore sync process, you can use `DataStore.stop()`.  This will close the real time subscription connection when your app is no longer interested in updates. You will typically call `DataStore.stop()` just before your application is closed.  You can also force your [DataStore sync expressions](/lib/datastore/sync) to be re-evaluated at runtime by calling `stop()` followed by `start()`.

import ios6 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/ios/other-methods/30_stop.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios6}} />

import android7 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/android/other-methods/30_stop.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android7}} />

import flutter4 from "/src/fragments/lib/datastore/flutter/other-methods/30_stop.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter4}} />
