React Native and Expo apps using `react-native` 0.70+ enable the Hermes engine by default, which does not currently support `asyncIterator` out of the box. DataStore requires adding the following to the entry point of your app to polyfill `asyncIterator` support:

```js
import '@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill';
```
