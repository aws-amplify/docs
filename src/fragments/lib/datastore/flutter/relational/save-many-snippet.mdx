Add the model above to the `schema.graphql` file located by default at `amplify/backend/{api_name}/` and regenerate the models again with the following command:

```bash
amplify codegen models
```

Once it is regenerated, save your posts with many-to-many mode like the following:

```dart
import 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';

import 'models/ModelProvider.dart';

Future<void> savePostAndEditor() async {
  final post = Post(
    title: 'My First Post',
    rating: 10,
    status: PostStatus.INACTIVE,
  );
  final editor = User(username: 'Nadia');
  final postEditor = PostEditor(post: post, user: editor);

  try {
    // first you save the post
    await Amplify.DataStore.save(post);

    // secondly, you save the editor/user
    await Amplify.DataStore.save(editor);

    // then you save the model that links a post with an editor
    await Amplify.DataStore.save(postEditor);
  } on DataStoreException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Something went wrong saving model: ${e.message}');
  }
}
```
