## Selectively syncing a subset of your data

By default, DataStore downloads the entire contents of your cloud data source to your local device.
The max number of records that will be stored is configurable [here](/lib/datastore/conflict#custom-configuration).

You can utilize selective sync to only persist a subset of your data instead.

Selective sync works by applying predicates to the base and delta sync queries, as well as to incoming subscriptions.

```dart
Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyDataStore(
  modelProvider: ModelProvider.instance,
  syncExpressions: [
    DataStoreSyncExpression(Post.classType, () => Post.RATING.gt(5)),
    DataStoreSyncExpression(Comment.classType, () => Comment.STATUS.eq('active'))
  ]));
```

When DataStore starts syncing, only Posts with `rating > 5` and Comments with `status` equal to `active` will be synced down to the user's local store.

Developers should only specify a single `syncExpression` per model. Any subsequent expressions for the same model will be ignored.
