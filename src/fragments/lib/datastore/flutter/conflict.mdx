DataStore has a few optional configurations, such as the ability to specify a custom handler for error messages that take place in any part of the system.

Finally you can configure the number of records to sync as an upper bound on items (per-Model) which will be stored locally on the device, as well as a custom interval in minutes which is an override of the default 24 hour "base query" which runs as part of the Delta Sync process.

### Custom configuration fields
- `errorHandler` - handler function executed when Datastore encounters an unhandled error during its background operations.
- `syncMaxRecords` - the maximum number of records to sync per execution.
- `syncPageSize` - the page size of each sync execution.
- `syncInterval` - the maximum interval (in seconds) for which the system will continue to perform delta queries. After this interval expires, the system performs a base query to retrieve all data.
- `syncExpressions` - sets a set of sync expressions for a particular model to filter which data is synced locally.  The expression is evaluated each time DataStore is started.

Configuration field `conflictHandler` is not available just yet for Flutter. We are actively working on this. Track our progress with this [issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/230).

### Example

```dart
import 'models/ModelProvider.dart';

AmplifyDataStore datastorePlugin = AmplifyDataStore(
  modelProvider: ModelProvider.instance,
  errorHandler: ((error) =>
      {print("Custom ErrorHandler received: " + error.toString())}),
  // Sync configuration defaults:
  syncInterval: 86400,
  syncMaxRecords: 10000,
  syncPageSize: 1000,
);
```
