Custom conflict resolution configuration is not available just yet for Flutter. We are actively working on this. Track our progress with this [issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/230)

Other custom configuration fields are supported in Flutter.

```dart
import 'models/ModelProvider.dart';

AmplifyDataStore datastorePlugin = AmplifyDataStore(
          modelProvider: ModelProvider.instance,
          // Sync configuration defaults:
          syncInterval: 86400,
          syncMaxRecords: 10000,
          syncPageSize: 1000);
```
