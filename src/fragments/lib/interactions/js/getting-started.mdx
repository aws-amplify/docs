AWS Amplify Interactions category enables AI-powered chatbots in your web or mobile apps. You can use *Interactions* to configure your backend chatbot provider and to integrate a chatbot UI into your app with just a single line of code.

## Interactions with AWS

AWS Amplify implements [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex) as the default chatbots service. Amazon Lex supports creating conversational bots with the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa.

## Create new chatbot

> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

Run the following command in your project's root folder:

```bash
amplify add interactions
```

The CLI will lead you through the steps to specify the chatbot to be created. 

You can choose to start from a sample chatbot or start from scratch.  If you choose to start from scratch, the CLI will prompt you with a series of questions to set the intents and slots for the chatbot. 

You are allowed to run the `amplify add interactions` command multiple times to add multiple chatbots into your project.

<Callout warning>
The Interactions category utilizes the Authentication category behind the scenes to authorize your app to send analytics events.
</Callout>

The `add` command automatically creates a backend configuration locally. To update your backend in the cloud, run:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon successful execution of the push command, a configuration file called `aws-exports.js` will be copied to your configured source directory, for example `./src`. 

> If your Interactions resources were created with Amplify CLI version 1.6.4 and below, you will need to manually update your project to avoid Node.js runtime issues with AWS Lambda. [Read more](/cli/migration/lambda-node-version-update)

## Manual setup

You can create Amazon Lex chatbox in Amazon Lex console. To create your bot, follow the steps shown in [Amazon Lex Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

With manual setup, you need to provide your auth credentials and bot details to configure your app:

```javascript
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    identityPoolId: 'us-east-1:xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx',
    region: 'us-east-1'
  },
  Interactions: {
    bots: {
      "BookTrip": {
        "name": "BookTrip",
        "alias": "$LATEST",
        "region": "us-east-1",
      },
    }
  }
});
```

## Configure frontend

Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `App.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import Amplify, { Interactions } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

## ChatBot UI component

Use the `ChatBot` component to add conversational UI to your app. [Learn more](/ui-legacy/interactions/chatbot).
