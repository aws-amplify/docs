AWS Amplify Interactions category enables AI-powered chatbots in your web or mobile apps. You can use _Interactions_ to configure your backend chatbot provider and to integrate a chatbot UI into your app with just a single line of code.

## Interactions with AWS

AWS Amplify implements [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex) as the default chatbots service. Amazon Lex supports creating conversational bots with the same deep learning technologies that power Amazon Alexa.

<Callout>
  The recommended approach is to begin your new App integration with AWS LexV2, as the default module exports are associated with AWS LexV2 APIs. Instructions for AWS LexV1 setup can be found in the following section.
</Callout>

## Setup AWS LexV2 bot
You can create Amazon Lex V2 chatbot in Amazon Lex console. To create your bot, follow the steps shown in [Amazon Lex V2 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

With manual setup, you also need to add AWS Lex V2 API permissions to IAM roles and bot details to configure your app.

For adding IAM permissions, find you IAM role and attach the policy below (*remember to replace the template with real value*):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lex:RecognizeText",
        "lex:RecognizeUtterance"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lex:<Region>:<Account>:bot-alias/<BotId>/<BotAliasId>"
    }
  ]
}
```

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
Amplify.configure({
  ...Amplify.getConfig(),
  Interactions: {
    LexV2: {
      "<V2BotName>": {
        aliasId: "<V2BotAliasId>",
        botId: "<V2BotBotId>",
        localeId: "<V2BotLocaleId>",
        region: "<V2BotRegion>"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

## Setup AWS LexV1 bot

### Create new LexV1 chatbot with Amplify CLI

> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

Run the following command in your project's root folder:

```bash
amplify add interactions
```

<Callout>

Adding interactions from the CLI only allows you to create a Lex V1 bot. If you want to create a LexV2 bot, you can do so following the [instructions here](#lex-v2-bot).

</Callout>

The CLI will lead you through the steps to specify the chatbot to be created.

You can choose to start from a sample chatbot or start from scratch. If you choose to start from scratch, the CLI will prompt you with a series of questions to set the intents and slots for the chatbot.

You are allowed to run the `amplify add interactions` command multiple times to add multiple chatbots into your project.

<Callout warning>
  The Interactions category utilizes the Authentication category behind the
  scenes to authorize your app to send analytics events.
</Callout>

The `add` command automatically creates a backend configuration locally. To update your backend in the cloud, run:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon successful execution of the push command, a configuration file called `amplifyconfiguration.json` will be copied to your configured source directory, for example `./src`.

> If your Interactions resources were created with Amplify CLI version 1.6.4 and below, you will need to manually update your project to avoid Node.js runtime issues with AWS Lambda. [Read more](/cli/function/configure-options)

### Manual setup
You can create Amazon Lex V1 chatbot in Amazon Lex console. To create your bot, follow the steps shown in [Amazon Lex V1 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/getting-started.html).

With manual setup, you need to add AWS Lex API permissions to IAM roles and bot details to configure your app.

For adding AWS Lex API permissions, find you IAM role and attach the policy below (*remember to replace the template with real value*):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "lex:PostText",
        "lex:PostContent"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lex:<Region>:<Account>:bot:<BotName>:<BotAlias>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Configuring bot details in your web app like this:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
Amplify.configure({
  ...Amplify.getConfig(),
  Interactions: {
    LexV1: {
      '<V1BotName>': {
        alias: '<V1BotAlias>',
        region: '<V1BotRegion>'
      }
    }
  }
});
```
