Import and load the configuration file in your app. It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `App.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify, Interactions } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```
