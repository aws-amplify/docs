<Block name="Swift Package Manager">

To start adding the Amplify Libraries to your iOS project, open your project in Xcode and select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.

![Add package dependency](/images/project-setup/20_4_add-package-dependency.png)

Enter the Amplify iOS GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios`) into the search bar and click **Next**.

![Search for repo](/images/project-setup/20_5_search-amplify-repo.png)

You'll see the Amplify iOS repository rules for which version of Amplify you want Swift Package Manager to install. Choose the first rule, **Version**, as it will use the latest compatible version of the dependency that can be detected from the `main` branch, then click **Next**.

Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. Always select the **Amplify** library. The "Plugin" to install depends on which categories you are using:

- API: **AWSAPIPlugin**
- Analytics: **AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin**
- Auth: **AWSCognitoAuthPlugin**
- DataStore: **AWSDataStorePlugin**
- Storage: **AWSS3StoragePlugin**

  _Note: AWSPredictionsPlugin is not currently supported through Swift Package Manager due to different minimum iOS version requirements. Support for this will eventually be added._

![Select dependencies](/images/project-setup/20_7_select-dependencies.png)

Select all that are appropriate, then click **Finish**.

You can always go back and modify which SPM packages are included in your project by opening the Swift Packages tab for your project: Click on the Project file in the Xcode navigator, then click on your project's icon, then select the **Swift Packages** tab.

<Callout>

You must explicitly import plugins in your app code when using Swift Package Manager to install Amplify, as in:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSAPIPlugin
import AWSDataStorePlugin
```

This is a result of Swift Package Manager's importing only relevant pieces of the dependency being installedâ€“in this case, the categories of Amplify.

<Block name="CocoaPods">

Before starting this step, please make sure you **close Xcode.**

**Open a terminal** and **change directories to your project**.  For example, if you created your project in the folder `~/Developer`, you can:
```bash
cd ~/Developer/MyAmplifyApp
```

In order to initialize your project with the CocoaPods package manager, **execute the command**:
```bash
pod init
```

After doing this, you should see a newly created file called `Podfile`.  This file is used to describe what packages your project depends on.

**Update the file** to include the `Amplify` pod:
```
target 'MyAmplifyApp' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Amplify'
end
```

To download and install the Amplify pod into your project, **execute the command**:
```bash
pod install --repo-update
```

After doing this, you should now see file called `MyAmplifyApp.xcworkspace`.  You are required to use this file from now on instead of the .xcodeproj file.  To open your workspace, **execute the command**:
```bash
xed .
```
This should open the newly generated MyAmplifyApp.xcworkspace in Xcode.
