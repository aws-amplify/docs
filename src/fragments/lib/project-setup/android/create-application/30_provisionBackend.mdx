To start provisioning resources in the backend, change directories to your project directory and run `amplify init`:

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/[platform]/start/project-setup/prerequisites/#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli) the Amplify CLI.

```bash
amplify init
```

Enter the following when prompted:

```console
? Enter a name for the project
    `MyAmplifyApp`
? Initialize the project with the above configuration?
    `No`
? Enter a name for the environment
    `dev`
? Choose your default editor:
    `Android Studio`
? Choose the type of app that you're building
    `android`
? Where is your Res directory:
    `app/src/main/res`
? Select the authentication method you want to use:
    `AWS profile`
? Please choose the profile you want to use
    `default`
```

Upon successfully running `amplify init`, you will see a configuration file created in `./app/src/main/res/raw/` called `amplifyconfiguration.json`.

This file will be bundled into your application so that the Amplify libraries know how to reach your provisioned backend resources at runtime.
