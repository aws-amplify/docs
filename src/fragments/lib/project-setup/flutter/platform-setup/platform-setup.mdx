## iOS
From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and modify the `Podfile` using a text editor of your choice and update the target iOS platform to 11.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

<Callout>

When preparing your application for deployment, you should also update your iOS Deployment Target to at least 11.0. See the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios) to learn more about building your iOS app for release.

</Callout>

## Android
From your project root, navigate to the `android/app/` directory and modify `build.gradle` using a text editor of your choice and update the target Android SDK version to 21 or higher:

```bash
minSdkVersion 21
```

import flutter1 from '/src/fragments/start/getting-started/flutter/kotlin-version-warning.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ flutter: flutter1 }} />

## iOS
From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and modify the `Podfile` using a text editor of your choice and update the target iOS platform to 13.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

## Android

From your project root, navigate to the `android/app/` directory and modify `build.gradle` using a text editor of your choice and update the target Android SDK version to 24 or higher:

```bash
minSdkVersion 24
```

## macOS
To run the Amplify-Flutter developer preview on macOS, you will need to update the minimum platform version to 10.15, and enable networking, keychain [entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements), and signing.

### Update Minimum Version 

From your project root, navigate to the `macos/` directory and modify the `Podfile` using a text editor of your choice and update the target macOS platform to 10.15 or higher.

```bash
platform :osx, '10.15'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Target -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the version to 10.15 or higher.

Select Runner, Project -> Runner and then the "Info" tab. Update "macOS Deployment Target" to 10.15 or higher.

### Enable network calls

In order to run your application locally, you must enable the [Client Networking [entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client).

In Xcode, enable the App Sandbox capability and then select "Outgoing Connections (Client)" under "Network".

![XCode Entitlements Screen](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/xcode-entitlements.png)

### Enable keychain

Amplify Auth stores auth credentials in Keychain on macOS. The keychain option [kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecusedataprotectionkeychain?language=objc) is enabled by default, which makes it so that only your app has access to these credentials. This requires that your app be in at least one Keychain Access Group.

To enable keychain sharing, open your project in Xcode and select the "Signing and Capabilities" section, then click the "+ icon".

![XCode Enable Keychain Sharing](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/enable-keychain-access.png)

Search for "Keychain Sharing" in the subsequent modal, and add it.

![XCode Keychain Sharing Search](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/search-keychain-sharing.png)

Finally, scroll down to "Keychain Sharing" in the "Signing and Capabilities" and click the "+" icon. By default, your bundle ID will be used.

### Enable signing 

Add a development team in the "Signing and Capabilities" section and enable signing.

## Windows
No specific configuration steps are needed to begin using the Auth category on Windows; however, depending on how your Windows configuration and the method you use to run your Flutter app, you may need to change the file path length limitation.

## Linux
Amplify Flutter depends on [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) when targeting Linux. To run and debug an app that depends on Amplify Flutter, you must install `libsecret-1-dev`.

To install on Ubuntu, run:

/* cSpell:disable */
```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev
```
/* cSpell:enable */

This will also install dependencies of `libsecret-1-dev`, such as `libglib2.0-dev`, which is also required for to run and debug apps that depend on Amplify Flutter.

> The command to install might vary on other Linux distributions.

### Packaging Your App
To include the required dependencies when packaging your app with Snapcraft, include them in your `snapcraft.yaml` file. For more info, see [Flutter's documentation on releasing to the Snap Store](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux).

```yaml
parts:
  my-app:
    plugin: flutter
    source: .
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-0
```
