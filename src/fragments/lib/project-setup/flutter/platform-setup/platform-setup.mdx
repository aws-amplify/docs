## iOS
From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and modify the `Podfile` using a text editor of your choice and update the target iOS platform to 11.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '11.0'
```

<Callout>

When preparing your application for deployment, you should also update your iOS Deployment Target to at least 11.0. See the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios) to learn more about building your iOS app for release.

## MacOS
To run the Amplify-Flutter developer preview on MacOS, you will need to enable signing as well as networking and keychain [entitlements](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements).

### Enable network calls

In order to run your application locally, you must enable the [Client Networking entitlement](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client).

In Xcode, enable the App Sandbox capability and then select "Outgoing Connections (Client)" under "Network".

### Enable keychain

Amplify Auth stores auth credentials in Keychain on MacOS. The keychain option kSecUseDataProtectionKeychain (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecusedataprotectionkeychain?language=objc) is enabled by default, which makes it so that only your app has access to these credentials. This requires that your app be in at least one Keychain Access Group.

To enable keychain sharing, open your project in Xcode and select the "Signing and Capabilities" section, then click the "+ icon".

Search for "Keychain Sharing" in the subsequent modal, and add it.

Next, scroll down to "Keychain Sharing" in the "Signing and Capabilities" and click the "+" icon. By default, your bundle ID will be used.

Finally, add a development team in the "Signing and Capabilities" section and enable signing.

## Windows
No specific configuration steps are needed to begin using the Auth category on Windows; however, depending on how your Windows configuration and the method you use to run your Flutter app, you may need to change the file path length limitation.

## Linux
To run the Amplify-Flutter developer preview on Linux, you must install two libraries:

* libsecret-1-dev
* libglib2.0-dev

To install on Ubuntu, run:

```terminal
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev
sudo apt-get install -y ibglib2.0-dev
```

The command to install might vary slightly on other Linux distributions.
