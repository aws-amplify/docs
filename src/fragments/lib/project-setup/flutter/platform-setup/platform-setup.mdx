## iOS

Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 13.0 and Xcode 13.2 or higher when targeting iOS.

From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and open the `Podfile` in a text editor of your choice. At the top of the file, update the target iOS platform to 13.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the iOS version to 13.0 or higher.

## Android

Amplify requires a minimum of API level 24 (Android 7.0) when targeting Android.

From your project root, navigate to the `android/app/` directory and open `build.gradle` in the text editor of your choice. Update the minimum Android SDK version to 24 or higher:

```bash
minSdkVersion 24
```

## Web

There are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions when targeting web. You will need to use a browser supported by Flutter. See the following Flutter docs for more info:

- [Supported deployment platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms)
- [FAQ: Which web browsers are supported by Flutter?](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/web/faq#which-web-browsers-are-supported-by-flutter)

## macOS

Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 10.15 and Xcode 13.2 or higher when targeting macOS. Additionally, you will need to enable networking, keychain entitlements, and code signing.

### Update Minimum Version

From your project root, navigate to the `macos/` directory and open the `Podfile` in a text editor of your choice. Update the target macOS platform to 10.15 or higher.

```bash
platform :osx, '10.15'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the macOS version to 10.15 or higher.

![XCode Minimum Deployment Version](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/target-min-deployment-version.png)

Select Runner, Project -> Runner and then the "Info" tab. Update "macOS Deployment Target" to 10.15 or higher.

### Enable Network Calls

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "Signing and Capabilities" tab. Under "App Sandbox" select "Outgoing Connections (Client)".

![XCode Entitlements Screen](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/xcode-entitlements.png)

For more info on the Networking entitlement, see Apple's documentation on [com.apple.security.network.client](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_network_client).

### Enable Keychain Sharing

<Callout>

This capability is required because Amplify uses the Data Protection Keychain on macOS as a platform best practice. 
See [TN3137: macOS keychain APIs and implementations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3137-on-mac-keychains)
for more information on how Keychain works on macOS and the Keychain Sharing entitlement.

</Callout>

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "Signing and Capabilities" tab.

1. Click the "+ icon".

2. Search for "Keychain Sharing" in the subsequent modal, and add it.

![XCode Keychain Sharing Search](/images/project-setup/flutter/mac/search-keychain-sharing.png)

3. Scroll down to "Keychain Sharing" in the "Signing and Capabilities" and click the "+" icon. By default, your bundle ID will be used.

4. Finally, add a development team and enable signing.

## Windows

There are no Amplify specific requirements or setup instructions when targeting Windows. You will need to use a Windows version supported by Flutter. See the following Flutter docs for more info:

- [Supported deployment platforms](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/supported-platforms)

<Callout>
  Depending on how your Windows configuration and the method you use to run your
  Flutter app, you may need to change the file path length limitation.
</Callout>

## Linux

Amplify Flutter depends on the [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) library when targeting Linux.

### Local Development

To run and debug an app that depends on Amplify Flutter, you must install `libsecret-1-dev`.

To install on Ubuntu, run:

<!-- cSpell:disable -->

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev
```
<!-- cSpell:enable -->

This will install `libsecret-1-dev` and any dependencies of `libsecret-1-dev`, such as `libglib2.0-dev`, which are also required to run and debug apps that depend on Amplify Flutter.

<Callout>
  The command to install might vary on other Linux distributions.
</Callout>

### Packaging Your App

To include the required dependencies when packaging your app with Snapcraft, include them in your `snapcraft.yaml` file. For more info, see [Flutter's documentation on releasing to the Snap Store](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux).

```yaml
parts:
  my-app:
    plugin: flutter
    source: .
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-0
```
