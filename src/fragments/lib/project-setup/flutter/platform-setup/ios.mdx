Amplify requires a minimum deployment target of 13.0 and Xcode 13.2 or higher when targeting iOS.

From your project root, navigate to the `ios/` directory and open the `Podfile` in a text editor of your choice. At the top of the file, update the target iOS platform to 13.0 or higher.

```bash
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

Open your project in Xcode and select Runner, Targets -> Runner and then the "General" tab. Under the "Minimum Deployments" section, update the iOS version to 13.0 or higher.
