Amplify uses SQLite via the [`drift`](https://pub.dev/packages/drift) package. This requires a custom build of SQLite when targeting web. You will need to download `sqlite3.wasm` from the [releases](https://github.com/simolus3/sqlite3.dart/releases) page of the `sqlite3` pub package and copy it into the `web/` directory of your Flutter project.
