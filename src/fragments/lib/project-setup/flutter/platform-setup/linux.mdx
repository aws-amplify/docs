Amplify Flutter depends on the [libsecret](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) library when targeting Linux.

### Local Development

To run and debug an app that depends on Amplify Flutter, you must install `libsecret-1-dev`.

To install on Ubuntu, run:

{/* cSpell:disable */}

```terminal
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libsecret-1-dev
```

{/* cSpell:enable */}

This will install `libsecret-1-dev` and any dependencies of `libsecret-1-dev`, such as `libglib2.0-dev`, which are also required to run and debug apps that depend on Amplify Flutter.

<Callout>
  The command to install might vary on other Linux distributions.

### Packaging Your App

To include the required dependencies when packaging your app with Snapcraft, include them in your `snapcraft.yaml` file. For more info, see [Flutter's documentation on releasing to the Snap Store](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux).

```yaml
parts:
  my-app:
    plugin: flutter
    source: .
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-0
```
