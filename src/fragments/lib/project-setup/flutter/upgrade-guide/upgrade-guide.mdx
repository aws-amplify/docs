With the release of v1 Amplify Flutter now supports Web and Desktop for Auth, API, Analytics, and Storage use cases. Developers can build cross-platform Flutter apps with Amplify that target iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux) using a single codebase.

We have re-written our libraries in Dart. In some places, we have made breaking changes to improve ergonomics or enable features that had been missing from the v0 implementations.

## Prerequisites

- A Flutter application targeting Flutter SDK >= 3.3.0 with Amplify libraries integrated

Amplify requires a minimum target platform for iOS (13.0), Android (API level 24), and macOS (10.15). Additional setup is required for some target platforms. Please see the [platform setup](/[platform]/start/project-setup/platform-setup/) guide for more details on platform-specific setup.

## Platform Setup

The requirements for individual platforms have been modified in some cases. If you haven't done so already, go through the [project setup](/[platform]/start/project-setup/platform-setup/) guide 
to make sure each platform has been configured correctly.

## Auth

- `fetchAuthSession` has several changes. See the example below for how to migrate.
  - `Amplify.Auth.getPlugin()` has been added to return plugin-specific subtypes. Casting to `CognitoAuthSession` is no longer needed when using this method.
  - The `getAWSCredentials` flag was previously needed to retrieve AWS credentials. This flag has been deprecated and is no longer needed. AWS credentials will always be included in the response.
  - `fetchAuthSession` will no longer throw exceptions. Instead, individual getters of type `AuthResult` will throw if the underlying operation fails.
    - _Why?_ The previous behavior did not allow for partial successes in offline scenarios when user pool tokens were still valid, but AWS credentials were expired. See [amplify-flutter#760](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues/760#issuecomment-1453559459) for more details.
  - `CognitoAuthSession.credentials`, `CognitoAuthSession.userPoolTokens`, `CognitoAuthSession.userSub`, and `CognitoAuthSession.identityId` are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `CognitoAuthSession.credentialsResult`, `CognitoAuthSession.userPoolTokensResult`, `CognitoAuthSession.userSubResult`, and `CognitoAuthSession.identityIdResult` instead.

```dart
// v0
try {
  final session = await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession(
    options: CognitoFetchAuthSessionOptions(getAWSCredentials: true),
  ) as CognitoAuthSession;

  final accessToken = session.userPoolTokens?.accessToken;
  safePrint('accessToken: $accessToken');

  final identityId = session.identityId;
  safePrint('identityId: $identityId');
} on AuthException catch (e) {
  // fetchAuthSession will fail if any of the underlying operations fail.
  safePrint('The operation failed: ${e.message}');
}
```

```dart
// v1
final session = await Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(
  AmplifyAuthCognito.pluginKey,
).fetchAuthSession();

// AuthResult.value will throw if the underlying operation failed.
try {
  final accessToken = session.userPoolTokensResult.value.accessToken.toJson();
  safePrint('accessToken: $accessToken');
} on SignedOutException {
  // the user is not signed in.
} on SessionExpiredException {
  // the users session has expired.
} on NetworkException {
  // the access and/or id token is expired but cannot be refreshed because the
  // user is offline.
}

// `AuthResult.valueOrNull` will return the identityId if present or null,
// but will never throw even if the underlying operation failed.
final identityId = session.identityIdResult.valueOrNull;
safePrint('identityId: $identityId');
```

- The next step returned from auth operations are now enums. See the example below for how to migrate for `Auth.signUp()`.

```dart
// v0
final result = await Amplify.Auth.signUp(/* ... */);
switch (result.nextStep?.signUpStep) {
  case 'CONFIRM_SIGN_UP':
    // prompt user to confirm sign in using nextStep.codeDeliveryDetails
    break;
  case 'DONE':
    // sign up is complete, user can be taken to an authenticated state.
    break;
}
```

```dart
// v1
final result = await Amplify.Auth.signUp(/* ... */);
switch (result.nextStep.signUpStep) {
  case AuthSignUpStep.confirmSignUp:
    // prompt user to confirm sign in using nextStep.codeDeliveryDetails
    break;
  case AuthSignUpStep.done:
    // sign up is complete, user can be taken to an authenticated state.
    break;
}
```

- Auth hub events now have a specific subtype (`AuthHubEvent`) and contain a `type` that is an enum. See the example below for how to migrate.

```dart
// v0
final hubSubscription = Amplify.Hub.listen([HubChannel.Auth], (hubEvent) {
  switch(hubEvent.eventName) {
    case 'SIGNED_IN':
      safePrint('User is signed in.');
      break;
    case 'SIGNED_OUT':
      safePrint('User is signed out.');
      break;
    case 'SESSION_EXPIRED':
      safePrint('The session has expired.');
      break;
    case 'USER_DELETED':
      safePrint('The user has been deleted.');
      break;
  }
});
```

```dart
// v1
final subscription = Amplify.Hub.listen(HubChannel.Auth, (AuthHubEvent event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case AuthHubEventType.signedIn:
      safePrint('User is signed in.');
      break;
    case AuthHubEventType.signedOut:
      safePrint('User is signed out.');
      break;
    case AuthHubEventType.sessionExpired:
      safePrint('The session has expired.');
      break;
    case AuthHubEventType.userDeleted:
      safePrint('The user has been deleted.');
      break;
  }
});
```

- Cognito-specific API options such as `CognitoSignInOptions` are deprecated in favor of `pluginOptions`. The classes will be removed in a future release. See below for an example of how to migrate for `Auth.signIn()`.

```dart
// v0
final result = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
  username: username,
  password: password,
  options: const CognitoSignInOptions(
    clientMetadata: {'data': 'value'},
  ),
);
```

```dart
// v1
final result = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
  username: username,
  password: password,
  options: const SignInOptions(
    pluginOptions: CognitoSignInPluginOptions(
      clientMetadata: {'data': 'value'},
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Social Sign-In (Hosted UI)

Configuration for social sign-in (Hosted UI) varies slightly in v1 compared to v0.

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="Android">

For Android, v0 required the following changes be made to your `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<queries>
  <intent>
      <action android:name=
          "android.support.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService" />
  </intent>
</queries>
<application>
  ...
  <activity
      android:name="com.amplifyframework.auth.cognito.activities.HostedUIRedirectActivity"
      android:exported="true">
      <intent-filter>
          <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
          <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
          <data android:scheme="myapp" />
      </intent-filter>
  </activity>
  ...
</application>
```

Start by removing this code, then update the `AndroidManifest.xml` as follows, replacing `myapp` with your custom URI scheme you configured in your backend.

```diff
+<queries>
+    <intent>
+        <action android:name=
+            "android.support.customtabs.action.CustomTabsService" />
+    </intent>
+</queries>
 <application>
  ...
  <activity
        android:name=".MainActivity" android:exported="true">
+        <intent-filter>
+            <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
+            <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
+            <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
+            <data android:scheme="myapp" />
+        </intent-filter>
  </activity>
-  <activity
-      android:name="com.amplifyframework.auth.cognito.activities.HostedUIRedirectActivity"
-      android:exported="true">
-      <intent-filter>
-          <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
-          <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
-          <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
-          <data android:scheme="myapp" />
-      </intent-filter>
-  </activity>
  ...
 </application>
```

</Block>

<Block name="iOS">


For iOS, v0 required the following changes be made to your `Info.plist`.

```xml
 <plist version="1.0">

     <dict>
     <!-- YOUR OTHER PLIST ENTRIES HERE -->

     <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
     <array>
         <dict>
             <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
             <array>
                 <string>myapp</string>
             </array>
         </dict>
     </array>

     <!-- ... -->
     </dict>
```

In v1, these changes are no longer required and can be safely removed without any effect on social sign-in (Hosted UI).

```diff
-     <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
-     <array>
-         <dict>
-             <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
-             <array>
-                 <string>myapp</string>
-             </array>
-         </dict>
-     </array>
```

</Block>

<Block name="Web/Desktop">

Web and Desktop platforms were not supported in v0.

Follow the instructions [here](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/add-social-provider/#platform-setup) to configure Web and Desktop platforms for social sign-in (Hosted UI) in v1.

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

## Analytics

- `AnalyticsProperties` renamed to `CustomProperties`
- `AnalyticsUserProfile` renamed to `UserProfile`
- `AnalyticsUserProfileLocation` renamed to `UserProfileLocation`
- In v0, the `autoFlushEventsInterval` in `amplifyconfiguration.dart` was read as seconds on iOS and milliseconds on Android. v1 fixes this behavior by reading `autoFlushEventsInterval` as seconds across all platforms.
- In v1, auto-flushing of events occurs at 30 second intervals. In v0, the default auto flush iOS was 60 seconds and Android was 30 seconds.
- Automatic session reporting behavior has been aligned in v1. For all platforms, backgrounding and foregrounding the app will stop and start a new session. Previously on iOS, the session would pause and then resume.
- You can now save to the `UserAttributes` field of a Pinpoint Endpoint by passing an `AWSPinpointUserProfile` to `identifyUser`.
- Analytics cached event data is now stored differently. Existing cached analytics events will not be migrated.
- There are now typed `AnalyticsException`s for specific exception cases.

## API

- REST API methods have breaking changes. See [REST API docs](/[platform]/build-a-backend/restapi/set-up-rest-api/) for more details.
- `RestException` has been replaced with `HttpStatusException`.
- GraphQL model helpers have a few changes:
  - Updated codegen models are required. Please upgrade to the latest version of the Amplify CLI and run `amplify codegen models`.
  - `ModelQueries.get()` and `ModelMutations.deleteById()` have a breaking change where the ID is no longer a `String` but a `ModelIdentifier` that supports custom primary keys. See [GraphQL docs](/[platform]/build-a-backend/graphqlapi/query-data/) for examples.
  - `ModelSubscriptions` helpers now take a `where` clause so users can get server-side subscription filters without a custom request.
- GraphQL subscriptions will attempt to automatically reconnect when the user's device loses and recovers internet access. Updates in connectivity status are available through new hub events on the channel `HubChannel.Api`.
- Server-side GraphQL errors on iOS no longer throw an exception, but instead return a `GraphQLResponse` with the errors in the `.errors` field (as has always been the case in Android). This applies to all platforms but is only a change for iOS. Note this is only true for errors that come from the AppSync server as part of the server-side GraphQL response. The client will still throw exceptions for cases when a valid response could not be successfully returned.
- Exceptions have been made more specific although they still extend abstract class `ApiException` so catch clauses that use `ApiException` will still be valid.

## Storage

- All Storage S3 plugin APIs now return an operation object rather than the result object. The operation object provides more control over the in-flight request, such as cancellation, pause, and resume capabilities (varies by API). The result `Future` can be retrieved via the `.result` property of the operation object. Here is an example for `uploadFile`:

```dart
// v0
final result = await Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
    local: exampleFile,
    key: 'ExampleKey',
);
print('Uploaded file key: ${result.key}')

// v1
final result = await Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
    localFile: exampleFile,
    key: 'ExampleKey',
).result;
print('Uploaded file key: ${result.uploadedItem.key}');
```

See [storage docs](/[platform]/build-a-backend/storage/set-up-storage/) for more detailed examples of other storage methods.
