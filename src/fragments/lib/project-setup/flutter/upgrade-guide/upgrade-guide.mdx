Amplify Flutter v2 has changes in Auth, Analytics, Storage, GraphQL API & DataStore that may require migration when upgrading from v1.

## Auth

#### Time Based One Time Password (TOTP) Exception Handling

In Amplify Flutter v1, `Amplify.Auth.verifyTotpSetup()` throws an `EnableSoftwareTokenMfaException` if the provided code was incorrect. In Amplify Flutter v2 a `CodeMismatchException` is thrown.

#### Auth Flow in Amplify Config

In Amplify Flutter v1, the value of `“authenticationFlowType”` from the Amplify configuration object is used as the default `AuthenticationFlowType` if none is provided when calling `Amplify.Auth.signIn()`. 

In Amplify Flutter v2, default type is `AuthenticationFlowType.userSrpAuth`. To change the authentication flow type, you can provide a value in the sign in options under `options` parameter..

```dart
await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
  username: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  options: const SignInOptions(
    pluginOptions: CognitoSignInPluginOptions(
      authFlowType: AuthenticationFlowType.userSrpAuth,
    ),
  ),
)
```


## Analytics

#### Configuration of `autoFlushEventsInterval`

In Amplify Flutter v1, the `autoFlushEventsInterval` value was configured manually in the `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file. In Amplify Flutter v2, the `autoFlushEventsInterval` value is not read from `amplifyconfiguration.dart` but instead is passed directly to the `AmplifyAnalyticsPinpoint()` constructor under the `AnalyticsPinpointPluginOptions`. The default value for `autoFlushEventsInterval` remains at 30 seconds, consistent with the behavior in Amplify Flutter v1.

## Storage

#### `key` and `StorageAccessLevel` have been replaced by `StoragePath`

In Amplify Flutter v1, files operations were performed based on a `key` and an `AccessLevel`. Amplify translated these values to a full file path. The `AccessLevel` (guest, protected, or private) determined what prefix to use (`“public/”`, `“protected/<user_identity_id>/”`, or `“private/<user_identity_id>/”`). Amplify Flutter v1 forms the full path using the prefix and the provided key.

Amplify Flutter v2 allows for full control of the path of the storage object. Storage paths can be constructed either from a static string or from the current users identity id using the `StoragePath` class.

To migrate from v1 to v2, replace all uses of `key` with `path` and remove uses of `StorageAccessLevel`. The path should include the prefix that was previously added by Amplify automatically.

##### Example Migration for Public Files

```dart
// upload file to "public/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v1
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  key: 'file.txt',
  options: StorageUploadFileOptions(
    accessLevel: StorageAccessLevel.guest,
  ),
);
```

```dart
// upload file to "public/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v2
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  path: const StoragePath.fromString("public/file.txt"),
);
```

##### Example Migration for Protected Files

```dart
// upload file to "protected/<user_identity_id>/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v1
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  key: 'file.txt',
  options: StorageUploadFileOptions(
    accessLevel: StorageAccessLevel.protected,
  ),
);
```

```dart
// upload file to "protected/<user_identity_id>/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v2
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  path: StoragePath.fromIdentityId(
    (identityId) => "protected/$identityId/file.txt",
  ),  
);
```

##### Example Migration for Private Files

```dart
// upload file to "private/<user_identity_id>/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v1
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  key: 'file.txt',
  options: StorageUploadFileOptions(
    accessLevel: StorageAccessLevel.private,
  ),
);
```

```dart
// upload file to "private/<user_identity_id>/file.txt" in Amplify Flutter v2
Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: file,
  path: StoragePath.fromIdentityId(
    (identityId) => "private/$identityId/file.txt",
  ),  
);
```

#### Prefix Resolver has been removed

With the introduction of `StoragePath`, there is no need for a prefix resolver. Simply specify the full path when constructing the `StoragePath`. 

#### Delimiter has been moved to the List API Options

In Amplify Flutter v1 `AmplifyStorageS3` accepted a `delimiter` option. This was used in list operations to determine sub paths. This option is now available as part of the List API options.

```dart
final result = Amplify.Storage.list(
  path: const StoragePath.fromString('public/album/'),
  options: const StorageListOptions(
    pageSize: 50,
    pluginOptions: S3ListPluginOptions(
      excludeSubPaths: true,
      delimiter: '/'
    ),
  ),
);
```

## DataStore

#### Configuration

In Amplify Flutter v1, the `AmplifyDataStore()` constructor allows for the customization of the plugin through optional parameters such as errorHandler, conflictHandler, syncExpression, syncInterval, syncMaxRecords, syncPageSize, and authModeStrategy. In Amplify Flutter v2, these parameters have been relocated under DataStorePluginOptions, with default values that mirror those of Amplify Flutter v1.

## Models & Query Predicates (GraphQL API & DataStore)

#### Configuration

In Amplify Flutter v1, the `AmplifyAPI()` constructor accepts optional parameters such as authProviders, baseHttpClient, modelProvider, and subscriptionOptions. In Amplify Flutter v2, these parameters have been relocated to `APIPluginOptions`.

#### Generated Models

##### Model.fromJson()

Amplify Flutter v2 now decodes AppSync GraphQL responses in their original shape (#816). In doing so, we’ve removed the previous transformations that happened after receiving an AppSync response. This requires data Models to be regenerated with the latest Amplify CLI. After upgrading to Amplify Flutter v2 please run the following:

```bash
$ amplify upgrade
# from the root of your Flutter project
$ amplify codegen models
```

##### Model.getId()

Amplify Flutter v2 removes all usage of the generated `Model.getId()` method. Replace all instances of `Model.getId()` and with `Model.modelIdentifier`. 

#### Nested Model Query Predicates

Query predicates for nested model relationships when passing Model.id for equal and not equal operations are no longer supported. Please update your query predicates to use Model.modelIdentifier, for example: 

```diff
- Post.BLOG.eq(blog1.id)
+ Post.BLOG.eq(blog1.modelIdentifier)
    
```
Or

```diff
- Post.BLOG.eq("1234") => 
+ Post.BLOG.eq(BlogModelIdentifier(id: "1234"))
    
```

#### Support For Only Custom Primary Key Enabled Back-Ends 

Amplify Flutter V2 no longer supports the Amplify CLI feature flag `respectprimarykeyattributesonconnectionfield` to be **disabled**. 

_If this feature flag is already enabled in your current project you can skip this section._

| `graphql.schema` | Feature Flag On   | Feature Flag off |
| -----------------| --------------- | ---------------- |
| **has `@primaryKey`**| No further action required  | Start at step 1. |
| **no `@primaryKey`** |No further action required  | Skip to step 4.  |

If the feature flag is turned off **AND** your model schema has the `@primaryKey` annotation, please follow these migration steps.

If the feature flag is turned off, but your `graphql.schema` does not contain references to `@primaryKey`, jump to step 4.

1. Remove `@primaryKey` references from your `graphql.schema`
2. Run `$ amplify push`
3. Run `$ amplify codegen models`
4. Enabled the feature flag: 
    1. Locate `amplify/cli.json` inside your project
    2. Enable the feature flag: 
```json
"features": {
    "graphqltransformer": {
      ...
      "respectprimarykeyattributesonconnectionfield": true,
      ...
    },
}
```
5. Run `$ amplify push`
6. Run `$ amplify codegen models`
