 In **Select a Project Template**, select **Flutter Application**. Press **Next**.

Next, configure your project:

2. Make sure your Flutter SDK path is set correctly to where it is installed on your machine 
3. Press **Next**. On the next screen, press **Finish**.

Android Studio will open your project with a tab opened to *main.dart*

import flutter0 from "/src/fragments/lib/project-setup/native_common/prereq/flutter_null_safety.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter0}} />

If you use CocoaPods, modify your Podfile to target iOS platform 11.0 or higher.  Within your project open `ios/Podfile` and change the second line to be `platform :ios, '11.0'.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods

# make sure you are in the ios folder
pod init
```

In XCode, select your project in the Project Navigator and select the "Info" tab.  Set the Deployment Target to at least 11.0.

You now have an empty Flutter project into which you'll add Amplify in the next steps.
