<Callout warning>

If you are using Flutter (2.2.0), you need to disable sound null safety by following the instructions [here](https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety#testing-or-running-mixed-version-programs). Null safety support for Amplify Flutter is being worked on actively.

</Callout>

If you use CocoaPods, modify your Podfile to target iOS platform 11.0 or higher.  Within your project open `ios/Podfile` and change the second line to be `platform :ios, '11.0'.

```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods

# make sure you are in the ios folder
pod init
```

In XCode, select your project in the Project Navigator and select the "Info" tab.  Set the Deployment Target to at least 11.0.

You now have an empty Flutter project into which you'll add Amplify in the next steps.
