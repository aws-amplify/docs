## Install the Amplify CLI

The Amplify Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified toolchain to create AWS cloud services for your app. Let's go ahead and install the Amplify CLI.

import all0 from '/src/fragments/cli-install-block.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: all0 }} />

import config from '/src/fragments/cli-config.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ all: config }} />

Next, you'll set up your app and initialize Amplify!
