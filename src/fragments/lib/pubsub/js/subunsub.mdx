## Subscribe
### Subscribe to a topic

In order to start receiving messages from your provider, you need to subscribe to a topic as follows;
```javascript
PubSub.subscribe('myTopic').subscribe({
    next: data => console.log('Message received', data),
    error: error => console.error(error),
    close: () => console.log('Done'),
});
```

If multiple providers are defined in your app you can include the specific provider you would like to subscribe to:
```javascript
PubSub.subscribe('myTopic', { provider: 'AWSIoTProvider' }).subscribe({
    //...
});

PubSub.subscribe('myTopic', { provider: 'MqttOverWSProvider' }).subscribe({
    //...
});
```

<Callout>

**Note:** If you do not include a specific provider it will subscribe to all of the configured PubSub providers in your app.

</Callout>

Following events will be triggered with `subscribe()`

Event | Description 
`next` | Triggered every time a message is successfully received for the topic
`error` | Triggered when subscription attempt fails 
`close` | Triggered when you unsubscribe from the topic

### Subscribe to multiple topics

To subscribe for multiple topics, just pass a String array including the topic names:
```javascript
PubSub.subscribe(['myTopic1','myTopic1']).subscribe({
    //...
});
```

## Unsubscribe

To stop receiving messages from a topic, you can use `unsubscribe()` method:
```javascript
const sub1 = PubSub.subscribe('myTopicA').subscribe({
    next: data => console.log('Message received', data),
    error: error => console.error(error),
    close: () => console.log('Done'),
});

sub1.unsubscribe();
// You will no longer get messages for 'myTopicA'
```
