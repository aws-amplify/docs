## Reset password
In order to reset your password, use the resetPassword api - this will send a code to the user attribute configured to receive such a reset code (e.g. email or SMS):

import ios0 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/ios/password_management/10_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios0}} />

import android1 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/android/password_management/10_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android1}} />

import flutter2 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/flutter/password_management/10_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter2}} />

To complete the password reset process, invoke the confirmResetPassword api with the code you were sent and the new password you want.

<Callout>
Note that you must call confirmResetPassword in the same app session as you call resetPassword. If you close the app, you'll need to call resetPassword again.
As a result, for testing purposes, you'll at least need an input field where you can enter the code sent by the resetPassword api and feed it to confirmResetPassword.
</Callout>

import ios3 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/ios/password_management/20_confirm_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios3}} />

import android4 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/android/password_management/20_confirm_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android4}} />

import flutter5 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/flutter/password_management/20_confirm_reset_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter5}} />

## Change password
A signed in user can update their password using the updatePassword api:

import ios6 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/ios/password_management/30_change_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios6}} />

import android7 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/android/password_management/30_change_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android7}} />

import flutter8 from "/src/fragments/lib/auth/flutter/password_management/30_change_password.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{flutter: flutter8}} />
