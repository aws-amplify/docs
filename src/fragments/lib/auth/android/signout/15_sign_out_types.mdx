## Sign Out Result Types

### CompleteSignOut
Indicates a successful sign out with no errors.

### PartialSignOut
Indicates that sign out was completed, but with errors. 
The device credentials have been cleared and the user is locally signed out of the device.
The `PartialSignOut` class will return 1 or more errors where sign out actions can be retried manually.
* `GlobalSignOutError` - The GlobalSignOut action failed.
    - `error`: A `GlobalSignOutException` that provides a message and recovery suggestion for the failure.
    - `accessToken`: The access token that was unable to be revoked. The Escape Hatch can be used to manually retry the global sign out.
* `RevokeTokenError` - The RevokeToken action failed.
    - `error`: A `RevokeTokenException` that provides a message and recovery suggestion for the failure.
    - `refreshToken`: The refresh token that was unable to be revoked. The Escape Hatch can be used to manually retry revoking the token.
* `HostedUIError` - The HostedUI sign out action failed.
    - `error`: A `HostedUISignOutException` that provides a message and recovery suggestion for the failure.
    - `url`: The url that was used to attempt the Cognito web session sign out in the CustomTab. 

### FailedSignOut
Indicates a failed sign out where user credentials remain on the device. 
See the attached AuthException to determine the cause. 
The most likely exception is a `UserCancelledException` where the user cancelled a HostedUI Sign Out before the redirect was received.
