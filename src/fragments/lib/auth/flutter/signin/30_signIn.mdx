```dart
// Create a boolean for checking the sign in status
bool isSignedIn = false;

Future<void> signInUser(String username, String password) async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
      username: username,
      password: password,
    );

    setState(() {
      isSignedIn = result.isSignedIn;
    });

  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint(e.message);
  }
}
```

<Callout>
Please note that you will be prevented from successfully calling `signIn` if a user has already signed in and a valid session is active.  You must first call `signOut` to remove the original session.  When running on the iOS platform, you will be able to call `signIn` if the session has expired, while on Android you must first call `signOut` regardless.
