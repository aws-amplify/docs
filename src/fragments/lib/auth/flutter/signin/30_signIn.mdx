```dart
try {
  SignInResult res = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
    username: usernameController.text.trim(),
    password: passwordController.text.trim(),

Please note that you will be prevented from successfully calling `signIn` if a user has already signed in and a valid session is active.  You must first call `signOut` to remove the original session.  When running on the iOS platform, you will be able to call `signIn` if the session has expired, while on Android you must first call `signOut` regardless.
