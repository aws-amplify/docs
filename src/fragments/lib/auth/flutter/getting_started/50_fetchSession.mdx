After implementing Authentication in your app, you can check if a user is logged in by using the below function:

```dart
final result = await Amplify.Auth.fetchAuthSession()
```

 `CognitoAuthSession` will be have the `isSignedIn` property set to `false` if the user has not signed in to your app.

```dart
final user = await Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser();
```

`AuthUser` will have the `userId` and `username` will have the user details if they were logged in.
