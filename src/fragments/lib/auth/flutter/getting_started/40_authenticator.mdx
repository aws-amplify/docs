## Authentication with Amplify

There are 2 options to add authentication capabilities to your application:
- Option 1: Use Authenticator UI Library (Developer Preview)
- Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

## Option 1: Use Authenticator UI Library

<Callout>

Authenticator for `amplify-flutter` is in developer preview.

</Callout>

The amplify-flutter Authenticator UI library allows you to quickly create an authentication/registration flow within your app. The experience generated within your app will be determined by the `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file that is automatically generated for you after initializing your app, and adding auth or other categories. Here is an [example app](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify_authenticator/example) that utilizes Authenticator.

First, you need to add Authenticator as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file in your root folder of your app. 
```yaml
dependencies:
  amplify_flutter: ^0.3.0
  amplify_auth_cognito: ^0.3.0
  amplify_authenticator: ^0.1.0-rc.0
```
Second, you will have to import the authenticator at the top of your `./lib/main.dart` file:
```dart
import 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';
```
Thirdly, you will need to update the build method in the default Flutter app’s state in your `./lib/main.dart` file. The child of your Authenticator widget will be the widget that is rendered after your users successfully login:

```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final authenticator = Authenticator(
    child: const Scaffold(
      body: Center(child: Text('You are logged in!')),
    ),
  );

  return MaterialApp(
    title: 'Authenticator Demo',
    theme: ThemeData.light(),
    darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(),
    // The Authenticator component should be a descendant of your MaterialApp.
    home: authenticator,
  );
}
```
With these 3 simple steps, the basic Authenticator setup is complete.

## Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

Follow the instructions in [Sign In](/lib/auth/signin) to learn about how to integrate these authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.
