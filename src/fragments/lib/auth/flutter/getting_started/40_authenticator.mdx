## Authentication with Amplify

There are 2 options to add authentication capabilities to your application:
- Option 1: Use Amplify Authenticator UI Library
- Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

## Option 1: Use Authenticator UI Library

The Amplify Authenticator UI library allows you to quickly create an authentication/registration flow within your app. The experience generated within your app will be determined by the `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file that is automatically generated for you after initializing your app, and adding auth or other categories. 

Visit <a href="https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/components/authenticator?platform=flutter">https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/components/authenticator?platform=flutter</a> to get started.

## Option 2: Call Authentication APIs manually

Follow the instructions in [Sign In](/lib/auth/signin) to learn about how to integrate these authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.
