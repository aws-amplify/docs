However, if you need to access them in relation to working with an API outside Amplify or want access to AWS specific identifying information (e.g. IdentityId), you can access these implementation details by calling fetchAuthSession on the Cognito Auth Plugin. This will return a `CognitoAuthSession`, which has additional attributes compared to `AuthSession`, which is typically returned by fetchAuthSession. See the example below:

```dart
Future<void> fetchAuthSession() async {
  try {
    final cognitoPlugin = Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito.pluginKey);
    final result = await cognitoPlugin.fetchAuthSession();
    final identityId = result.identityIdResult.value;
    safePrint('identityId: $identityId');
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint(e.message);
  }
}
```

### Setting a timeout for fetchAuthSession

On spotty networks, the `fetchAuthSession` call can take upwards of a minute to either complete or fail due to internal retries. If this is too long, consider adding a custom timeout using the `timeout` function as shown in the below example.

```dart
Future<void> fetchAuthSessionWithTimeout() async {
  try {
    final cognitoPlugin = Amplify.Auth.getPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito.pluginKey);
    final result = await cognitoPlugin.fetchAuthSession().timeout(
          const Duration(seconds: 5),
        );
    final identityId = result.identityIdResult.value;
    safePrint('identityId: $identityId');
  } on AuthException catch (e) {
    safePrint('Something went wrong while fetching the session: $e');
  }
}
```
