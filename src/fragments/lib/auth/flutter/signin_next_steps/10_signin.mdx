The `Amplify.Auth.signIn` API returns a `SignInResult` object which indicates whether the sign-in flow is
complete or whether additional steps are required before the user is signed in.

To see if additional signin steps are required, inspect the sign in result's `nextStep.signInStep` property.
- If the sign-in step is `done`, the flow is complete and the user is signed in.
- If the sign-in step is not `done`, one or more additional steps are required. These are explained in detail below.


<Callout>

The `signInStep` property is an enum of type `AuthSignInStep`. Depending on its value, your code should take one of the actions mentioned on this page.

```dart
Future<SignInResult> signInWithCognito(
  String username,
  String password,
) async {
  final SignInResult result = await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
    username: username, 
    password: password,
  );
  return _handleSignInResult(result);
}

Future<void> _handleSignInResult(SignInResult result) async {
  switch (result.nextStep.signInStep) {
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithSmsMfaCode:
      // Handle SMS MFA case
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithNewPassword:
      // Handle new password case
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignInWithCustomChallenge:
      // Handle custom challenge case
    case AuthSignInStep.resetPassword:
      // Handle reset password case
    case AuthSignInStep.confirmSignUp:
      // Handle confirm sign up case
    case AuthSignInStep.done:
      safePrint('Sign in is complete');
  }
}
```
