The sign-in flow is complete when the next step is `done`, which means the user is successfully authenticated. 
As a convenience, the `SignInResult` also provides the `isSignedIn` property, which will be true if the next step is `done`.

```dart
Future<void> _handleSignInResult(SignInResult result) async {
  switch (result.nextStep.signInStep) {
    // ...
    case AuthSignInStep.done:
      // Could also check that `result.isSignedIn` is `true`
      safePrint('Sign in is complete');
  }
}
```
