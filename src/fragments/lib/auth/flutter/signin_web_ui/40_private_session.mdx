### Prefer private session during signIn on iOS.

Amplify-flutter uses the amplify-ios library on the iOS platform to facilitate Web UI sign in and other Auth functionality. See the [amplify-ios Web UI documentation](/lib/auth/signin_web_ui/q/platform/ios/#prefer-private-session-during-signin) for details on how amplify-ios manages the interaction between the application and the Web UI.

As noted in the amplify-ios documentation, it is possible to use a private session when calling `Auth.signInWithWebUI`. This will bypass the permissions dialog that is displayed to the end user.

```dart
Amplify.Auth.signInWithWebUI(
    options: CognitoSignInWithWebUIOptions(
        isPreferPrivateSession: preferPrivateSession
    )
)
```
