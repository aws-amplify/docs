In terminal, navigate to your project, run `amplify add auth` (or if you've already added it, run `amplify update auth`), and choose the following options:

```terminal
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? 
    `Default configuration with Social Provider (Federation)`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? 
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? 
    `No, I am done.`
? What domain name prefix you want us to create for you? 
    `(default)`
? Enter your redirect signin URI: 
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signin URI 
    `Yes`
? Enter your redirect signin URI: 
    `http://localhost:3000/`
? Do you want to add another redirect signin URI 
    `No`
? Enter your redirect signout URI: 
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signout URI 
    `No`
? Enter your redirect signout URI: 
    `http://localhost:3000/`
? Do you want to add another redirect signout URI 
    `No`
? Select the social providers you want to configure for your user pool: 
    `<hit enter>`
```

Note that when the CLI asks for the redirect URIs that you want to use, you may need to enter multiple:

* Desktop apps require an http localhost (ex: http://localhost:3000)
* Web requires an http localhost or https URI (ex: http://localhost:3000 or https://www.yourapp.com)
* Mobile requires a custom app URI (ex: myapp://)
