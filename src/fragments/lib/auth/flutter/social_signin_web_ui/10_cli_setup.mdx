Once you have the social provider configured, run the following in your project’s root folder

```bash
amplify add auth     ## "amplify update auth" if already configured
```

Choose the following options (the last steps are specific to Facebook here but are similar for other providers):

```terminal
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? 
    `Default configuration with Social Provider (Federation)`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? 
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? 
    `No, I am done.`
? What domain name prefix you want us to create for you? 
    `(default)`
? Enter your redirect signin URI: 
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signin URI 
    `Yes`
? Enter your redirect signin URI: 
    `http://localhost:3000/`
? Do you want to add another redirect signin URI 
    `No`
? Enter your redirect signout URI: 
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signout URI 
    `Yes`
? Enter your redirect signout URI: 
    `http://localhost:3000/`
? Do you want to add another redirect signout URI 
    `No`
? Select the social providers you want to configure for your user pool: 
    `<choose your provider and follow the prompts to input the proper tokens>`
```
