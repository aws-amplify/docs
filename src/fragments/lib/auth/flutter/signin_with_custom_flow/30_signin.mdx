<Callout>
  Please note that you will be prevented from successfully calling `signIn` if a
  user has already signed in and a valid session is active. You must first call
  `signOut` to remove the original session. When running on the iOS platform,
  you will be able to call `signIn` if the session has expired, while on Android
  you must first call `signOut` regardless.
