Amplify Flutter uses the underlying storage mechanisms used by amplify-android (EncryptedSharedPreferences) and amplify-ios (Keychain), and does not offer customization.

<Block name="Developer Preview (Mobile, Web & Desktop)">

Amplify Flutter's developer preview for web and desktop support offers a `SecureStorageInterface` interface which can be used to customize how  user-related information is stored on each platform. An instance of this interface can be passed into the `AmplifyAuthCognito` constructor.

Some options can be configured directly with `AmplifySecureStorage` while still using the native platform storage mechanisms. If you need further control over the underlying  such as `read` and `write`, create a class which implements `SecureStorageInterface` and pass that instead.

For example, the `AmplifyAuthCognito` plugin uses IndexedDB to persist tokens and credentials on web so that this data remains available when the user refreshes or closes their browser. If you'd like to only persist these values in memory, you can change the persistence option like so:

```dart
await Amplify.addPlugin(
  AmplifyAuthCognito(
    credentialStorage: AmplifySecureStorage(
      config: AmplifySecureStorageConfig(
        scope: 'auth',
        webOptions: WebSecureStorageOptions(
          persistenceOption: WebPersistenceOption.inMemory,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  ),
);
```
