Once you have the social provider configured, run the following in your projectâ€™s root folder

```bash
amplify add auth     ## "amplify update auth" if already configured
```

Choose the following options (the last steps are specific to Facebook here but are similar for other providers):

```terminal
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration with Social Provider (Federation)`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
? What domain name prefix you want us to create for you?
    `(default)`
? Enter your redirect signin URI:
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signin URI
    `No`
? Enter your redirect signout URI:
    `myapp://`
? Do you want to add another redirect signout URI
    `No`
? Select the social providers you want to configure for your user pool:
    `Sign in with Apple`
? Enter your Services ID for your OAuth flow:
    `<your Service ID>`
? Enter your Team ID for your OAuth flow:
    `<your Team ID>`
? Enter your Key ID for your OAuth flow:
    `<your Key ID>`
? Enter your Private Key for your OAuth flow (entire key without line breaks):
    `<the entire content -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- <key> -----END PRIVATE KEY----- from your .p8 file in a single line>`

```
