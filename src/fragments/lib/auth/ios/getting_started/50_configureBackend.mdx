> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/ios/#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify libraries and [necessary dependencies](/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios/#install-amplify-libraries).

To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add auth
```

Enter the following when prompted:
```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration?
    `Default configuration`
? How do you want users to be able to sign in?
    `Username`
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?
    `No, I am done.`
```

> If you have previously enabled an Amplify category that uses Auth behind the scenes (e.g. API category), you can run the `amplify update auth` command to edit your configuration if needed. 

To push your changes to the cloud, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify push
```

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/ios/#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify libraries and [necessary dependencies](/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios/#install-amplify-libraries).

To import existing Amazon Cognito resources into your Amplify project, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify import auth
```
```console
? What type of auth resource do you want to import?
   Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
   Cognito User Pool only
```

Once you've selected an option, you'll be able to search for and import an existing Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool (or User Pool only) within your AWS account.  The `amplify import auth` command will also do the following:
- Automatically populate your Amplify Library configuration file (`awsconfiguration.json`) with your chosen Amazon Cognito resource information
- Provide your designated existing Cognito resource as the authentication & authorization mechanism for all auth-dependent categories (API, Storage and more)
- Enable Lambda functions to access the chosen Cognito resource if you permit it

> If you have previously enabled an Amplify category that uses Auth behind the scenes (e.g. API category), you can run the `amplify update auth` command to edit your configuration if needed. 

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` should be updated to reference provisioned backend auth resources.

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

<Block name="Amplify Studio"> 

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/ios/#install-and-configure-the-amplify-cli) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify libraries and [necessary dependencies](/lib/auth/getting-started/q/platform/ios/#install-amplify-libraries).

Amplify Studio allows you create auth resources, set up authorization rules, implement Multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more via an intuitive UI. To set up Authentication through the Amplify Studio, take the following steps: 

1. **Sign in** to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and open AWS Amplify.
2. In the navigation pane, **choose an application**.
3. On the application information page, choose the **Backend environments** tab, then choose **Launch Studio**.
4. On the **Set up** menu, choose **Authentication**.
5. In the **Configure log in** section, choose a login mechanism to add from the **Add login mechanism** list. Valid options are _Username_, _Phone number_, _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, and _Sign in with Apple_. If you choose one of the social sign-in mechanisms (i.e. _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, or _Sign in with Apple_), you will also need to enter your _App ID_, _App Secret_, and redirect URLs.
6. (Optional) Add multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is set to **Off** by default. To turn on MFA, do the following in the **Multi-factor authentication** section:
* Choose **Enforced** to require MFA for all users or choose **Optional** to allow individual users to enable MFA.
* (Optional) Choose **SMS**, and enter your SMS message.
* (Optional) Choose **Authenticator Application** if you want your app to load with an authentication flow that includes sign up and sign in.
7. In the **Configure sign up** section, expand **Password protection settings** and customize the password policy settings to enforce. u6. Choose **Save and Deploy**. This starts a CloudFormation deployment with the progress displayed in the upper right corner of the page.
8. After creating and configuring your auth resources, you'll need to pull them down from Amplify Studio.  To do so, simply click on "Local setup instructions" in the upper right hand corner of the Studio console and execute the CLI command it provides at the root directory of your app. 

> You can also [import](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/auth/import/) existing Amazon Cognito resources and [manage users and groups](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/auth/user-management/) through the Amplify Studio UI.

<Block name="Existing Resources">

If you are not using the Amplify CLI, existing Authentication resources from AWS (e.g. Amazon Cognito UserPools or Identity Pools) can be used with the Amplify Libraries by [manually creating a configuration file](/lib/project-setup/use-existing-resources/q/platform/ios/#1-manually-create-the-amplify-configuration-file-for-your-ios-project) (`amplifyconfiguration.json`) and then updating the associated Plugin within it:
