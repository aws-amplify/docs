To use Auth in a macOS project, you'll need to enable the Keychain Sharing capability. In Xcode, navigate to **your application target** > **Signing & Capabilities** > **+ Capability**, then select **Keychain Sharing.**

This capability is required because Auth uses the Data Protection Keychain on macOS as a platform best practice.
See [TN3137: macOS keychain APIs and implementations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3137-on-mac-keychains) for more information on how Keychain works on macOS and the Keychain Sharing entitlement.

For more information on adding capabilities to your application, see [Xcode Capabilities](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/capabilities).
