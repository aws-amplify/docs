## Authentication with Amplify

There are two ways to add authentication capabilities to your application.

### Option 1: Use the Authenticator UI component

The **Authenticator** is a UI component that automatically integrates with your existing Amplify configuration and allows you to easily add the entire authentication flow to your application.

Visit [Authenticator | Amplify UI for Swift](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/swift/connected-components/authenticator) to get started.

### Option 2: Manually call the Authentication APIs

Follow the instructions in [Sign In](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/enable-sign-in/) to learn about how to integrate the registration and authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.
