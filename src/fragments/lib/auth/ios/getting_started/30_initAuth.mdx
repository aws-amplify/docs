To initialize the Amplify Auth category, pass in the AWSCognitoAuthPlugin to `Amplify.add()`.  When we are done calling `add()` on each category that we need, we finish configuring Amplify by calling `Amplify.configure()`.

**Add the following imports**:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
```

**Configure Amplify at app launch**

Configure Amplify in the App `init`

```swift
@main
struct MyAmplifyApp: App {

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }

    init() {
        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            try Amplify.configure()
            print("Amplify configured with auth plugin")
        } catch {
            print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

Add to your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {

    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with auth plugin")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

Upon building and running this application you should see the following in your console window:

```bash
Amplify configured with auth plugin
```
