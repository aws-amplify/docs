`AWSCognitoAuthPlugin` allows you to switch between different auth flows while initiating signIn. You can configure the flow in the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file or pass the `authFlowType` as a runtime parameter to the `signIn` api call.

For client side authentication there are four different flows that can be configured during runtime:

1. `userSRP`: The `userSRP` flow uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol" target="_blank">SRP protocol (Secure Remote Password)</a> where the password never leaves the client and is unknown to the server. This is the recommended flow and is used by default.

2. `userPassword`: The `userPassword` flow will send user credentials unencrypted to the back-end. If you want to migrate users to Cognito using the "Migration" trigger and avoid forcing users to reset their passwords, you will need to use this authentication type because the Lambda function invoked by the trigger needs to verify the supplied credentials.

3. `customWithSRP`: The `customWithSRP` flow is used to start with SRP authentication and then switch to custom authentication. This is useful if you want to use SRP for the initial authentication and then use custom authentication for subsequent authentication attempts.

4. `customWithoutSRP`: The `customWithoutSRP` flow is used to start authentication flow **WITHOUT** SRP and then use a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements.

`Auth` can be configured to use the different flows at runtime by calling `signIn` with `AuthSignInOptions`'s `authFlowType` as `AuthFlowType.userPassword`, `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithoutSrp` or `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithSrp`. If you do not specify the `AuthFlowType` in `AuthSignInOptions`, the default flow (`AuthFlowType.userSRP`) will be used.

```swift 
public enum AuthFlowType: String {

    /// Authentication flow for the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol
    case userSRP

    /// Authentication flow for custom flow which are backed by lambda triggers.
    /// Note that `custom`will always begin with a SRP flow.
    @available(*, deprecated, message: "Use of custom is deprecated, use customWithSrp or customWithoutSrp instead")
    case custom

    /// Authentication flow which start with SRP and then move to custom auth flow
    case customWithSRP

    /// Authentication flow which starts without SRP and directly moves to custom auth flow
    case customWithoutSRP

    /// Non-SRP authentication flow; user name and password are passed directly.
    /// If a user migration Lambda trigger is set, this flow will invoke the user migration
    /// Lambda if it doesn't find the user name in the user pool.
    case userPassword
}
```

Runtime configuration will take precedence and will override any auth flow type configuration present in amplifyconfiguration.json

## USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow

A use case for the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow is migrating users into Amazon Cognito

```swift
func signIn(username: String, password: String) async throws {

    let option = AWSAuthSignInOptions(authFlowType: .userPassword)
    do {
        let result = try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(
            username: username,
            password: password,
            options: AuthSignInRequest.Options(pluginOptions: option))
        print("Sign in succeeded with result: \(result)")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to sign in with error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

### Setup auth backend

In order to use the authentication flow `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH`, your Cognito app client has to be configured to allow it. In the AWS Console, this is done by ticking the checkbox at General settings > App clients > Show Details (for the affected client) > Enable username-password (non-SRP) flow. If you're using the AWS CLI or CloudFormation, update your app client by adding `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` to the list of "Explicit Auth Flows".

### Migrate users with Amazon Cognito

Amazon Cognito provides a trigger to migrate users from your existing user directory seamlessly into Cognito. You achieve this by configuring your User Pool's "Migration" trigger which invokes a Lambda function whenever a user that does not already exist in the user pool authenticates, or resets their password.

In short, the Lambda function will validate the user credentials against your existing user directory and return a response object containing the user attributes and status on success. An error message will be returned if an error occurs. There's a documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-import-using-lambda.html) on how to set up this migration flow and more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-migrate-user.html#cognito-user-pools-lambda-trigger-syntax-user-migration) on how the lambda should handle request and response objects.

## CUSTOM_AUTH flow

Amazon Cognito User Pools supports customizing the authentication flow to enable custom challenge types, in addition to a password in order to verify the identity of users. The custom authentication flow is a series of challenge and response cycles that can be customized to meet different requirements. These challenge types may include CAPTCHAs or dynamic challenge questions.

To define your challenges for custom authentication flow, you need to implement three Lambda triggers for Amazon Cognito.

The flow is initiated by calling `signIn` with `AuthSignInOptions` configured with `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithSrp` OR `AuthFlowType.customAuthWithoutSrp`.

Follow the instructions in [Custom Auth Sign In](/lib/auth/signin_with_custom_flow) to learn about how to integrate custom authentication flow in your application with the Auth APIs.
