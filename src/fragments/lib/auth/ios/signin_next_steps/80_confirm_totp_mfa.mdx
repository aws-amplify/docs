If the next step is `confirmSignInWithTOTPCode`, you should prompt the user to enter the TOTP code from their associated authenticator app during set up. The code is a six-digit number that changes every 30 seconds. The user must enter the code before the 30-second window expires.

After the user enters the code, your implementation must pass the value to Amplify Auth `confirmSignIn` API.
