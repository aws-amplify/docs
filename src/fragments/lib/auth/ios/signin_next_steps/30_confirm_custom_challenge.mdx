If the next step is `confirmSignInWithCustomChallenge`, Amplify Auth is awaiting completion of a custom authentication challenge. The challenge is based on the Lambda trigger you setup when you configured a [custom sign in flow](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/sign-in-custom-flow/). To complete this step, you should prompt the user for the custom challenge answer, and pass the answer to the `confirmSignIn` API.

```swift
func confirmSignIn(challengeAnswerFromUser: String) async {
    do {
        let signInResult = try await Amplify.Auth.confirmSignIn(challengeResponse: challengeAnswerFromUser)
        if signInResult.isSignedIn {
            print("Confirm sign in succeeded. The user is signed in.")
        } else {
            print("Confirm sign in succeeded.")
            print("Next step: \(signInResult.nextStep)")
            // Switch on the next step to take appropriate actions.
            // If `signInResult.isSignedIn` is true, the next step
            // is 'done', and the user is now signed in.

<Callout warning>

<b>Special Handling on ConfirmSignIn</b>

During a confirmSignIn call if `failAuthentication=true` is returned by the lambda the session of the request gets invalidated by cognito, a NotAuthorizedException is returned and a new signIn call is expected via Amplify.Auth.signIn

```swift
Exception:  notAuthorized{message=Failed since user is not authorized., cause=NotAuthorizedException(message=Invalid session for the user.), recoverySuggestion=Check whether the given values are correct and the user is authorized to perform the operation.}
```
