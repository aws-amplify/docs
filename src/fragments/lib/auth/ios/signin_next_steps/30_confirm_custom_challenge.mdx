If the next step is `confirmSignInWithCustomChallenge`, Amplify Auth is awaiting completion of a custom authentication challenge. The challenge is based on the Lambda trigger you setup when you configured a [custom sign in flow](/lib/auth/signin_with_custom_flow). To complete this step, you should prompt the user for the custom challenge answer, and pass the answer to the `confirmSignIn` API.
