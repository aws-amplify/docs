? What functionality do you want to use for Define Auth Challenge? 
    `Custom Auth Challenge Scaffolding (Definition)`

? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-create-challenge function now? 
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-create-challenge.js
```
The boilerplate for Create Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
//crypto-secure-random-digit is used here to get random challenge code - https://github.com/ottokruse/crypto-secure-random-digit
const digitGenerator = require('crypto-secure-random-digit');

function sendChallengeCode(emailAddress, secretCode) {
  // Use SES or custom logic to send the secret code to the user.
}

function createAuthChallenge(event) {

  if (event.request.challengeName === 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE') {
    
      // Generate a random code for the custom challenge
      const challengeCode = digitGenerator.randomDigits(6).join('');
      
      // Send the custom challenge to the user
      sendChallengeCode(event.request.userAttributes.email, challengeCode);
      
      event.response.privateChallengeParameters = {};
      event.response.privateChallengeParameters.answer = challengeCode;
  }
}

exports.handler = async event => {
  createAuthChallenge(event);
};
```

<Callout>
Note that the  `sendChallengeCode` method is empty, you can use AWS service like SES to setup email delivery and populate the function `sendChallengeCode` to send the challenge code to the user.
</Callout>

Amazon Cognito invokes the Create Auth Challenge trigger after Define Auth Challenge to create a custom challenge. In this lambda trigger we define the challenge to present to the user. `privateChallengeParameters` contains all the information to validate the response from the user.
Save and close the file. Now open the file under "<your_xcode_project>/amplify/backend/function/<project_code>CreateAuthChallenge/src/package.json" and add the following:

```js
"dependencies": {
    "crypto-secure-random-digit": "^1.0.9"
}
```

Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

```
? Press enter to continue
    `Hit Enter`

? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-define-challenge function now? 
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-define-challenge.js
```
The boilerplate for Define Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
exports.handler = async function(event) {
  if (event.request.session.length == 1 && event.request.session[0].challengeName == 'SRP_A') {
      event.response.issueTokens = false;
      event.response.failAuthentication = false;
      event.response.challengeName = 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE';
  } else if (event.request.session.length == 2 && event.request.session[1].challengeName == 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE' && event.request.session[1].challengeResult == true) {
      event.response.issueTokens = true;
      event.response.failAuthentication = false;
      event.response.challengeName = 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE';
  } else {
      event.response.issueTokens = false;
      event.response.failAuthentication = true;
  }
}
```
Amazon Cognito invokes the Define Auth Challenge trigger to initiate the custom authentication flow.

The Amplify Auth library always starts with an SRP_A flow, so in the code above, we bypass SRP_A and return `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE` in the first step. In the second step, if `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE` return with `challengeResult == true` we recognize the custom auth challenge is successful, and tell Cognito to issue tokens. In the last `else` block we tell Cognito to fail the authentication flow.

Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

```
? Press enter to continue
    `Hit Enter`

? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-verify function now?
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-verify.js
```
The boilerplate for Verify Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
function verifyAuthChallengeResponse(event) {
  if (event.request.privateChallengeParameters.answer === event.request.challengeAnswer) {
      event.response.answerCorrect = true;
  } else {
      event.response.answerCorrect = false;
  }
}

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  verifyAuthChallengeResponse(event);
};
```
Amazon Cognito invokes the Verify Auth Challenge trigger to verify if the response from the end user for a custom challenge is valid or not. The response from the user will be available in `event.request.challengeAnswer`. The code above compares that with `privateChallengeParameters` value set in the Create Auth Challenge trigger.
Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

Once finished, run `amplify push` to publish your changes.
