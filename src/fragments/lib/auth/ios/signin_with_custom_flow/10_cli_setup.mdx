? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-create-challenge function now?
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-create-challenge.js
```

The boilerplate for Create Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
//crypto-secure-random-digit is used here to get random challenge code - https://github.com/ottokruse/crypto-secure-random-digit
const digitGenerator = require('crypto-secure-random-digit');

function sendChallengeCode(emailAddress, secretCode) {
  // Use SES or custom logic to send the secret code to the user.
}

function createAuthChallenge(event) {
  if (event.request.challengeName === 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE') {
    // Generate a random code for the custom challenge
    const challengeCode = digitGenerator.randomDigits(6).join('');

    // Send the custom challenge to the user
    sendChallengeCode(event.request.userAttributes.email, challengeCode);

    event.response.privateChallengeParameters = {};
    event.response.privateChallengeParameters.answer = challengeCode;
  }
}

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  createAuthChallenge(event);
};
```

<Callout>
  Note that the `sendChallengeCode` method is empty, you can use AWS service
  like SES to setup email delivery and populate the function `sendChallengeCode`
  to send the challenge code to the user.
</Callout>

Amazon Cognito invokes the Create Auth Challenge trigger after Define Auth Challenge to create a custom challenge. In this lambda trigger you define the challenge to present to the user. `privateChallengeParameters` contains all the information to validate the response from the user. Save and close the file. Now open the file under "\<your_xcode_project>/amplify/backend/function/\<project_code>CreateAuthChallenge/src/package.json" and add the following:

```js
{
  "name": "<AUTH_CHALLENGE_NAME>",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "Lambda function generated by Amplify",
  "main": "index.js",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/aws-lambda": "^8.10.92"
  }, // <- Include comma

  // Add the following lines
  "dependencies": {
    "crypto-secure-random-digit": "^1.0.9"
  }
}
```

Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

```
? Press enter to continue
    `Hit Enter`

? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-define-challenge function now?
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-define-challenge.js
```

The boilerplate for Define Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
exports.handler = async function (event) {
  if (event.request.session.length == 0) {
    event.response.issueTokens = false;
    event.response.failAuthentication = false;
    event.response.challengeName = 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE';
  } else if (
    event.request.session.length == 1 &&
    event.request.session[0].challengeName == 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE' &&
    event.request.session[0].challengeResult == true
  ) {
    event.response.issueTokens = true;
    event.response.failAuthentication = false;
    event.response.challengeName = 'CUSTOM_CHALLENGE';
  } else {
    event.response.issueTokens = false;
    event.response.failAuthentication = true;
  }
};
```

Amazon Cognito invokes the Define Auth Challenge trigger to initiate the custom authentication flow. In the first step you define the auth flow to go through Custom Challenge. In the second if block, if `CUSTOM_CHALLENGE` returns with `challengeResult == true` you recognize the custom auth challenge is successful, and tell Cognito to issue tokens. In the last `else` block you tell Cognito to fail the authentication flow.

Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

```
? Press enter to continue
    `Hit Enter`

? Do you want to edit your boilerplate-verify function now?
    `Yes`
? Please edit the file in your editor: <local file path>/src/boilerplate-verify.js
```

The boilerplate for Verify Auth Challenge opens in your favorite code editor. Enter the following code to this file:

```js
function verifyAuthChallengeResponse(event) {
  if (
    event.request.privateChallengeParameters.answer ===
    event.request.challengeAnswer
  ) {
    event.response.answerCorrect = true;
  } else {
    event.response.answerCorrect = false;
  }
}

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  verifyAuthChallengeResponse(event);
};
```

Amazon Cognito invokes the Verify Auth Challenge trigger to verify if the response from the end user for a custom challenge is valid or not. The response from the user will be available in `event.request.challengeAnswer`. The code above compares that with `privateChallengeParameters` value set in the Create Auth Challenge trigger. Save and close the file, then switch back to the terminal and follow the instructions:

```
? Press enter to continue
    `Hit Enter`
```

Once finished, run `amplify push` to publish your changes.
