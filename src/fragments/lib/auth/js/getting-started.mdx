## Authentication with Amplify

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery & other operations. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add authentication to your application using Amazon Cognito and username/password login.

## Create authentication service

To start from scratch, run the following command in your project's root folder:

> If you want to re-use an existing authentication resource from AWS (e.g. Amazon Cognito UserPool or Identity Pool) refer to [this section](/lib/auth/start#re-use-existing-authentication-resource).

```bash
amplify add auth
```

```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?  No, I am done.
```

To deploy the service, run the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

## Configure your application

import js0 from '/src/fragments/lib/auth/js/getting-started-steps-basic-auth.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: js0 }} />

import reactnative0 from '/src/fragments/lib/auth/js/getting-started-steps-basic-auth-react-native.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'react-native': reactnative0 }} />

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

## Enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out

import js1 from '/src/fragments/lib/auth/js/enable_sign_in_sign_up.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: js1 }} />

Follow the instructions in the [Sign in, Sign up and Sign out](/lib/auth/emailpassword) to learn about how to integrate these authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.

## Summary

To implement authentication flows using Amplify you can either use the Amplify UI libraries or call authentication methods directly on the `Auth` class.

`Auth` has over 30 methods including [`signUp`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-up), [`signIn`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-in), [`forgotPassword`](/lib/auth/manageusers#forgot-password), and [`signOut`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-out) that allow you full control over all aspects of the user authentication flow.
