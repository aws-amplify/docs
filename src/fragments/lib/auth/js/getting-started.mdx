## Authentication with Amplify

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery & other operations. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add authentication to your application using Amazon Cognito and username/password login.

## Set Up Backend Resources

To use Authentication with Amplify, you have the option to set up or import existing Amazon Cognito resources via the Amplify CLI or manually configure them in your application.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI (Create)">

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify libraries and [necessary dependencies](/lib/project-setup/create-application#n2-install-amplify-libraries).

To start provisioning auth resources in the backend, go to your project directory and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify add auth
```

```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?  No, I am done.
```
> If you have previously enabled an Amplify category that uses Auth behind the scenes (e.g. API category), you can run the `amplify update auth` command to edit your configuration if needed. 

The CLI prompts will help you to customize your auth flow for your app. With the provided options, you can:
- Customize sign-in/registration flow 
- Customize email and SMS messages for Multi-Factor Authentication
- Customize attributes for your users, e.g. name, email
- Enable 3rd party social providers, e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google and Amazon

If you wish to federate with social providers [you will need to configure them first](/lib/auth/social#social-providers-and-federation).

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

> Prerequisites: [Install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI in addition to the Amplify libraries and [necessary dependencies](/lib/project-setup/create-application#n2-install-amplify-libraries).

To import existing Amazon Cognito resources into your Amplify project, **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify import auth
```
```console
? What type of auth resource do you want to import?
   Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
   Cognito User Pool only
```

Once you've selected an option, you'll be able to search for and import an existing Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool (or User Pool only) within your AWS account.  The `amplify import auth` command will also do the following:
- Automatically populate your Amplify Library configuration files (aws-exports.js, amplifyconfiguration.json) with your chosen Amazon Cognito resource information
- Provide your designated existing Cognito resource as the authentication & authorization mechanism for all auth-dependent categories (API, Storage and more)
- Enable Lambda functions to access the chosen Cognito resource if you permit it

import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

<Block name="Manual Configuration">

Existing Authentication resources from AWS (e.g. Amazon Cognito UserPools or Identity Pools) can be used with the Amplify Libraries by calling the `Amplify.configure()` method. 

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    // REQUIRED only for Federated Authentication - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    identityPoolId: "XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab",

    // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    region: "XX-XXXX-X",

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Federated Identity Pool Region
    // Required only if it's different from Amazon Cognito Region
    identityPoolRegion: "XX-XXXX-X",

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolId: "XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234",

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
    userPoolWebClientId: "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3",

    // OPTIONAL - Enforce user authentication prior to accessing AWS resources or not
    mandatorySignIn: false,

    // OPTIONAL - This is used when autoSignIn is enabled for Auth.signUp
    // 'code' is used for Auth.confirmSignUp, 'link' is used for email link verification
    signUpVerificationMethod: "code", // 'code' | 'link'

    // OPTIONAL - Configuration for cookie storage
    // Note: if the secure flag is set to true, then the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol
    cookieStorage: {
      // REQUIRED - Cookie domain (only required if cookieStorage is provided)
      domain: ".yourdomain.com",
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie path
      path: "/",
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie expiration in days
      expires: 365,
      // OPTIONAL - See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
      sameSite: "strict" | "lax",
      // OPTIONAL - Cookie secure flag
      // Either true or false, indicating if the cookie transmission requires a secure protocol (https).
      secure: true,
    },

    // OPTIONAL - customized storage object
    storage: MyStorage,

    // OPTIONAL - Manually set the authentication flow type. Default is 'USER_SRP_AUTH'
    authenticationFlowType: "USER_PASSWORD_AUTH",

    // OPTIONAL - Manually set key value pairs that can be passed to Cognito Lambda Triggers
    clientMetadata: { myCustomKey: "myCustomValue" },

    // OPTIONAL - Hosted UI configuration
    oauth: {
      domain: "your_cognito_domain",
      scope: [
        "phone",
        "email",
        "profile",
        "openid",
        "aws.cognito.signin.user.admin",
      ],
      redirectSignIn: "http://localhost:3000/",
      redirectSignOut: "http://localhost:3000/",
      responseType: "code", // or 'token', note that REFRESH token will only be generated when the responseType is code
    },
  },
});

// You can get the current config object
const currentConfig = Auth.configure();
```
<Callout warning={true}>
If your existing UserPool client has a required attribute that is NOT set to mutable, you may face login issues when using Social sign-in. To resolve this, you will need to <ExternalLink href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">create a new UserPool client</ExternalLink> and mark the required attribute as mutable.
</Callout>

### OAuth configuration parameters:
These settings can be found in the Cognito User Pools console under **App Integration** section
- `domain`: This can be found in the **Domain name** sub section
- `scope`: Remember to have the scope allowed on the Cognito App client, this can be found on **App client settings** sub section
- `redirectSignIn`: URL must be present on **Callback URL(s)** , check on **App client settings** sub section
- `redirectSignOut`: URL must be present on **Sign out URL(s)**, check on **App client settings** sub section
- `responseType`: Option must be enabled on the App client, look for **Allowed OAuth Flows** on **App client settings** sub section. *Authorization code grant* is for 'code' value and *Implicit grant* is for 'token' value.

## Enable sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out

import js1 from '/src/fragments/lib/auth/js/enable_sign_in_sign_up.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: js1 }} />

Follow the instructions in the [Sign in, Sign up and Sign out](/lib/auth/emailpassword) to learn about how to integrate these authentication flows in your application with the Auth APIs.

## Summary

To implement authentication flows using Amplify you can either use the Amplify UI libraries or call authentication methods directly on the `Auth` class.

`Auth` has over 30 methods including [`signUp`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-up), [`signIn`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-in), [`forgotPassword`](/lib/auth/manageusers#forgot-password), and [`signOut`](/lib/auth/emailpassword#sign-out) that allow you full control over all aspects of the user authentication flow.

Check out the complete API [here](https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/api/classes/authclass.html).
