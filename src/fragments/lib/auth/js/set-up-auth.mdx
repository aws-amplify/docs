> *This guide provides essential information to help you select and complete the activities you need for your Amplify project. We organized each section around a distinct job or decision point to help you understand your available options, steps to complete, and recommended best practices.*

In this guide, you will learn how to set up Amplify **Auth**. This includes setting up and connecting your backend resources, determining your integration path, and enabling sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out. We will also provide more context on how resources are managed and created with Amplify to help you make decisions, and understand any long-term impact of those decisions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6.14.4 or later
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.14.1 or later
- A front-end app
- If you are want Amplify to set up and manage your backend resources you need to [install and configure](/lib/project-setup/prereq/q/platform/js/) the Amplify CLI. Make sure to also created a new amplify project using `amplify init` in your terminal, or pull in an existing amplify project to your frontend app using `amplify pull`.

## Set up and connect backend resources

We will also guide you on the paths to integrating Amplify Auth and how to set up and integrate your backend resources, and how to connect to these resources in your frontend app to build authentication features.

### Decide how to create and manage your backend resources

You can create and manage your Authentication resources with Amplify by using the Amplify CLI, Amplify Studio, or manage them yourself with tools such as CDK and CloudFormation. The path we recommend is via the Amplify CLI, which allows you to create new authentication resources or import existing ones. However, you can also use the Amplify Studio console to configure or use existing resources and directly connect them to your application using the Amplify Libraries. These tools will help you with creating and managing your resources.

With Amplify Auth, you can use a username and password as an authentication method, use a social provider Sign In with Google or Sign in With Apple, or create a fully custom authentication flow.

<Accordion title='Understanding Auth high-level concepts' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amplify helps you secure your application while providing an easy sign-in experience for your users. This experience is influenced by your security strategy. This security strategy includes the authentication method, security credentials, and enabling additional verification when needed.

 - *Authentication* is a process to validate **who you are** (abbreviated as *AuthN*). The system which does this validation is referred to as an Identity Provider or IdP. This can be your own self-hosted IdP or a cloud service. Oftentimes, this IdP is a social provider such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon.
 - *Authorization* is the process of validating **what you can access** (abbreviated as *AuthZ*). This is sometimes done by looking at tokens with custom logic, predefined rules, or signed requests with policies.

Common authentication methods and associated risks include: 
- Username/password which is simple to set up but prone to compromise.
- Social provider federation which enables easier access for your users but shares data with third parties. 

You can improve security credentials and verification for these authentication methods by: 
- Adding password policies that ensure stronger passwords are created by your users.
- Require additional contact information from users before they can reset passwords.
- Add multi-factor authentication which adds a layer of security at sign-in but may also add friction for your users.

<br/>

Amplify uses [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) as the main authentication provider. Amazon Cognito is a robust user directory service that handles user registration, authentication, account recovery, and other operations. If you have not worked with Amazon Cognito before we recommend taking a closer look at Amazon Cognito configuration options before you continue, since some of them are irreversible after your resources are created.

<Accordion title='Review Amazon Cognito configuration options' headingLevel='4' eyebrow='Learn more'>

Amazon Cognito can be customized based on your security strategy for authentication. However, there are some initial configuration options that cannot be changed after the backend resources are configured:

- User attributes that are used to identify your individual users (e.g. username, email, etc.) cannot be renamed or deleted.
- Login methods (including username, email, phone, etc.) cannot be added or changed after the initial configuration. This includes both defining which attributes are used to log-in and which attributes are required. Required attributes must have a value for all users once set.
- Verification methods (including username, email, etc.) are the same as required attributes and cannot be removed once configured.
- The `sub` attribute is a unique identifier within each user pool that cannot be modified and can be used to index and search users.
- If MFA is set to required for all users, you will need to include MFA setup when users sign up.

See the [Amazon Cognito documentation]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html) for more details on these settings including [User pool attributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-attributes.html) and [Adding MFA to a user pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-mfa.html).

### Set up and configure your Auth category

In this section you will learn more on how to set up your backend resources and install the Amplify libraries to use with your application.

During this workflow you can set up your password formats. If you have not worked with passwords formats recently we recommend taking a closer look at the best practices before you continue.

#### Set up your Auth backend resources

You can set up your backend resources with the Amplify CLI, Amplify Studio, or use existing resources.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Amplify CLI (Create)">

To start provisioning auth resources in your backend, go to your project directory and **execute the following command in your terminal**:

```bash
amplify add auth
```

```console
? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings?  No, I am done.
```

The above prompts will setup a default configuration for you. This includes:
- Username as the sign-in method
- Default password policy
- No MFA enabled
- No 3rd party social providers enabled

If you want to configure advanced settings, you can choose the `Manual configuration` option. The CLI prompts will help you to customize your auth flow for your app. With the provided options, you can:
- Customize sign-in/registration flow
- Customize email and SMS messages for Multi-factor authentication
- Customize attributes for your users (e.g. name, email)
- Enable custom auth flows
- Enable Cognito Lambda triggers
- Enable 3rd party social providers (e.g. Amazon, Facebook, Google and Sign In With Apple)


> If you wish to federate with social providers [you will need to configure them on the provider end first](/lib/auth/social#social-providers-and-federation).


After configuring your Authentication options, update and deploy the backend by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

The authentication service will be deployed after a few minutes, then you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

#### Install the Amplify Libraries

Once your backend resources are configured and deployed, you can now install the Amplify Libraries to use with your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

This will bootstrap your app to use Amplify with the deployed backend resources.

</Block>

<Block name="Amplify CLI (Import)">

To import existing Amazon Cognito resources into your Amplify project, **execute the following command in your terminal**:

```bash
amplify import auth
```
```console
? What type of auth resource do you want to import?
   Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool
   Cognito User Pool only
```

Once you've selected an option, you'll be able to search for and import an existing Cognito User Pool and Identity Pool (or User Pool only) within your AWS account and within the region that the Amplify project was created in. The `amplify import auth` command will also do the following:
- Automatically populate your Amplify Library configuration files (`aws-exports.js`) with your chosen Amazon Cognito resource information
- Provide your designated existing Cognito resource as the authentication and authorization mechanism for all auth-dependent categories (API, Storage and more)
- Enable Lambda functions to access the chosen Cognito resource if you permit it

After configuring your Authentication options, update your backend and deploy the service by running the `push` command:

```bash
amplify push
```

Now, the authentication service has been deployed and you can start using it. To view the deployed services in your project at any time, go to Amplify Console by running the following command:

```bash
amplify console
```

#### Install the Amplify Libraries

Once your backend resources are configured and deployed, you can now install the Amplify Libraries to use with your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

This will bootstrap your app to use Amplify with the deployed backend resources.

</Block>

<Block name="Amplify Studio">

Amplify Studio allows you create auth resources, set up authorization rules, implement Multi-factor authentication (MFA), and more via an intuitive UI. To set up Authentication through the Amplify Studio, take the following steps: 

1. **Sign in** to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) and open AWS Amplify.
2. In the navigation pane, **choose an application** or create a new one by choosing **New app** and selecting **Build an app**.
- For a new app, enter a name for your app, then choose **Create app**. It will take a few minutes to create the app environment.
- For an existing app, choose the **Backend environments** tab, then choose **Launch Studio** (or **Setup Studio** if you app isn't configured with studio yet) under the environment you are working with.
3. On the **Set up** menu, choose **Authentication**. This will default to **Start from scratch** where new Amazon Cognito resources will be created, however you can use existing resources by choosing **Reuse existing Amazon Cognito resources**.
4. In the **Configure log in** section, choose a login mechanism to add from the **Add login mechanism** list. Valid options are _Username_, _Phone number_, _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, and _Sign in with Apple_. If you choose one of the social sign-in mechanisms (i.e. _Facebook_, _Google_, _Amazon_, or _Sign in with Apple_), you will also need to enter your _App ID_, _App Secret_, and redirect URLs, as well as configure the provider end to work with Cognito.
5. (Optional) Add Multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is set to **Off** by default. To turn on MFA, do the following in the **Multi-factor authentication** section:
- Choose **Enforced** to require MFA for all users or choose **Optional** to allow individual users to enable MFA.
- (Optional) Choose **SMS**, and enter your SMS message.
- (Optional) Choose **Authenticator Application** if you want your app to load with an authentication flow that includes sign up and sign in.
6. In the **Configure sign up** section, expand **Password protection settings** and customize the password policy settings to enforce.
7. Choose **Save and Deploy**. This starts a CloudFormation deployment with the progress displayed in the upper right corner of the page.
8. After creating and configuring your auth resources, you'll need to pull them down from Amplify Studio. To do so, simply click on "Local setup instructions" in the upper right hand corner of the Studio console and execute the CLI command it provides at the root directory of your app. 

> Learn more on how you can [import](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/auth/import/) existing Amazon Cognito resources and [manage users and groups](https://docs.amplify.aws/console/auth/user-management/) through the Amplify Studio UI.

#### Install the Amplify Libraries

Once your backend resources are configured and deployed, you can now install the Amplify Libraries to use with your application by running the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

This will bootstrap your app to use Amplify with the deployed backend resources.

</Block>

<Block name="Existing Resources">

Existing Authentication resources from AWS (e.g. Amazon Cognito UserPools or Identity Pools) can be used with the Amplify Libraries by calling the `Amplify.configure()` method.

If you do not have Amplify Libraries, install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```sh
npm install aws-amplify
```

In your app's entry point (i.e. **App.js**, **index.js**, **_app.js**, or **main.js**), import and load the configuration file:

```javascript
import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  Auth: {
    // REQUIRED only for Federated Authentication - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
    identityPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab',

    // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
    region: 'XX-XXXX-X',

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Federated Identity Pool Region
    // Required only if it's different from Amazon Cognito Region
    identityPoolRegion: 'XX-XXXX-X',

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
    userPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234',

    // OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID (26-char alphanumeric string)
    userPoolWebClientId: 'a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3',
  },
});


// You can get the current config object
const currentConfig = Auth.configure();
```

<Callout warning={true}>
If your existing UserPool client has a required attribute that is NOT set to mutable, you may face login issues when using social sign-in. To resolve this, you will need to <ExternalLink href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html">create a new UserPool client</ExternalLink> and mark the required attribute as mutable.
</Callout>

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

**Recap:** You now have set up and configured your backend resources for Amplify authentication and are ready to start working on your front-end application.

## Determine your Auth integration path

Before you implement Auth on your front-end application, you will want to evaluate the options of using the Authenticator connected UI component or using the Amplify Library APIs directly. We recommend using the Authenticator since it creates a sign in and registration experience for your with few lines of code.

### Compare implementation options

There are a few options to implement Auth depending on how much customization you will need:

|  | Amplify Authenticator | Amplify Libraries |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Description** | Open source drop-in UI component for authentication | Low-level building blocks for implementing authentication |
| **Benefits** | Automatically integrates with your existing Amplify configuration and allows you to easily add the entire authentication flow to your application. You can then customize themes to adjust colors and styling as needed. | Gives you full control over the UI and logic implementation. |
| **Constraints** | Dependent on Amplify CLI for provisioning resources. | Requires the building of screens and frontend logic to enable the sign in and registration experiences. |

<br/>

**Recap:** We recommend using the Authenticator UI component for quick and easy set up and then use the Amplify Libraries to customize the user experience and logic as needed. Once you decide which option will work for your use case you can continue implementing authentication on your front-end application.

## Building an Authentication experience using the Authenticator

Creating the login flow can be quite difficult and time consuming to get right. However, Amplify has the Authenticator UI component which you can use that will provide the entire authentication flow for your app, using your backend configuration.

Amplify has pre-built UI components for React, Vue, Angular, React Native, Swift, Android, and Flutter.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="React">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-react` library.

> Note: You will also need to install `aws-amplify` as well if you have not already.

```sh
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react aws-amplify
```

Next, open __src/App.js__ and add the `Authenticator` component.

**Authenticator**

The `Authenticator` should wrap sections of your app that you want to protect. You will also notice the `user` and `signOut` are provided to the wrapped component.

**Usage**

```jsx
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

import { Authenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';
import '@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css';

import awsExports from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsExports);

function App({ signOut, user }) {
  return (
    <Authenticator>
      {({signOut, user}) => (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello, {user.username}</h1>
          <button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </Authenticator>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</Block>
<Block name="Vue 3">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-vue` library.

> Note: You will also need to install `aws-amplify` as well if you have not already.

```bash
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-vue aws-amplify
```

Next, open __src/App.js__ and add the `Authenticator` component.

**Authenticator**

The `Authenticator` should wrap sections of your app that you want to protect. You will also notice the `user` and `signOut` are provided to the wrapped component.

```html
<script setup>
  import { Authenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-vue";
  import "@aws-amplify/ui-vue/styles.css";

  import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
  import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

  Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
</script>

<template>
  <authenticator>
    <template v-slot="{ user, signOut }">
      <h1>Hello, {{ user.username }}</h1>
      <button @click="signOut">Sign Out</button>
    </template>
  </authenticator>
</template>
```

</Block>
<Block name="Angular">

First, install the `@aws-amplify/ui-angular` library.

> Note: You will also need to install `aws-amplify` as well if you have not already.

```bash
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-angular aws-amplify
```

Now open __app.module.ts__ and add the Amplify imports and configuration:

```js
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { AmplifyAuthenticatorModule } from '@aws-amplify/ui-angular';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import awsconfig from '../aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AmplifyAuthenticatorModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Next, import the default theme inside __styles.css__:

```css
@import '~@aws-amplify/ui-angular/theme.css';
```

Next, open __app.component.html__ and add the `amplify-authenticator` component.

**amplify-authenticator**

The `amplify-authenticator` should wrap sections of your app that you want to protect. You will also notice the `user` and `signOut` are provided to the wrapped component.

```html
<amplify-authenticator>
  <ng-template
    amplifySlot="authenticated"
    let-user="user"
    let-signOut="signOut"
  >
    <h1>Hello, {{ user.username }}!</h1>
    <button (click)="signOut()">Sign Out</button>
  </ng-template>
</amplify-authenticator>
```

</Block>
</BlockSwitcher>

Once you add the Authenticator component to your app, you can test the sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality. You can also [customize the Authenticator UI component](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/react/connected-components/authenticator/customization) to adjust colors and styling as needed.

### View the created user in the AWS Console

After creating a new user, you can validate the created user in the Amazon Cognito console. To do so, you can use `amplify console auth` to open the AWS console directly. Note the users status should be `CONFIRMED` if you successfully verified the user; however, it can be in `unconfirmed` if the user is not yet verified. You can also check to make sure your user attributes are updating correctly.

**Recap:** You now have enabled sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out for your authentication and verified its functionality with a test user.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You finished the **Set up Amplify Auth** guide. In this guide, you set up and connected to backend resources, compared and determined your Auth integration path, and enabled sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out.

## Next steps

Now that you completed setting up Amplify Auth with username/password you may also want to add some additional features. We recommend you learn more about:
  - [Social sign-in (OAuth)](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/social/q/platform/js/)
  - [Multi-factor authentication](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/auth/mfa/q/platform/js/)
