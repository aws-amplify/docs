Invoke the `deleteUser` API to delete a user from the Auth category. This action will also sign your user out.

If your application uses a Cognito User Pool, which is the default configuration for the Amazon Cognito plugin, this action will delete the user from the Cognito User Pool. It will have no effect if you are federating with a Cognito Identity Pool alone.

<Callout warning>
  Depending on your application, data associated with your user may be stored in
  other resources such as Amazon DynamoDB or AWS S3. It is recommended that you
  carefully evaluate this data and implement code to remove or otherwise
  sanitize it, if necessary, prior to giving users the ability to delete their
  own user record.

  Before invoking the “delete user” API, you can delete associated user data from the GraphQL API first. For example, if you are using Amplify CLI's GraphQL transformer to persist user data via owner based access control, <a target = "_blank" href ="https://gist.github.com/elorzafe/250f23895f5ae520dc6f311977602264" >follow these instructions </a> to delete associated user data.
This allows you to address common security guidelines requiring applications to delete data associated to a specific user, when the user deletes their account

```javascript
async function deleteUser() {
  try {
    const result = await Auth.deleteUser();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error deleting user', error);
  }
}
```
