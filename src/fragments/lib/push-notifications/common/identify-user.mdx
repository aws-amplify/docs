This call identifies the current user (which could be unauthenticated or authenticated) to Amazon Pinpoint. The user ID can be any string which identifies the user in the context of your application.

## Get the user ID from Amplify Auth

If the user is signed in through [Amplify.Auth.signIn](/lib/auth/signin), then you can retrieve the current user's ID as shown below:

import android0 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/android/identify_user/10_get_auth_user.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android0}} />

import ios1 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/identify_user/10_get_auth_user.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios1}} />

## Identify the user to Amazon Pinpoint

Once you have a string that identifies the current user (either from the Auth category as shown above or through your own application logic), you can identify the user to Amazon Pinpoint with the following:

import android3 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/android/identify_user/20_send_to_pinpoint.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android3}} />

import ios4 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/identify_user/20_send_to_pinpoint.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios4}} />

Alternatively, you can provide additional information about the user by passing a user profile:

import android6 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/android/identify_user/30_send_to_pinpoint_profile.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{android: android6}} />

import ios7 from "/src/fragments/lib/push-notifications/ios/identify_user/30_send_to_pinpoint_profile.mdx";

<Fragments fragments={{ios: ios7}} />
