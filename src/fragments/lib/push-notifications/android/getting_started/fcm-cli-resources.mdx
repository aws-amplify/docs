Choose _FCM_ when promoted:

```console
? Choose the push notification channel to enable.
  APNS |  Apple Push Notifications
❯ FCM  | » Firebase Push Notifications
  In-App Messaging
  Email
  SMS

? Provide your pinpoint resource name:
    `yourPinpointResourceName`

? Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guests and unauthenticated users to send analytics events? (we recommend you allow this when getting started) (Y/n)
    'Y'

```

The CLI will prompt for your _Server Key_, paste the **Token** you copied while [setting up push notification services](/[platform]/build-a-backend/push-notifications/set-up-push-service/).
