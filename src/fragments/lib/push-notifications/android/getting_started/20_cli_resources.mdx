<Callout warning>

Push Notifications requires version **10.8.0+** of the Amplify CLI. You can check your current version by typing `amplify -version` and upgrade to the latest version by typing `amplify upgrade`.

If you want to use existing AWS Pinpoint resources [follow this guide](/lib/push-notifications/existing-resources) instead.

To start provisioning push notifications resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

```sh
amplify add notifications
```

Choose *FCM* when promoted:

```console
? Choose the push notification channel to enable.
APNS
> FCM
Email
SMS
```

The CLI will prompt for your *ApiKey*, paste the **Token** you copied from the Firebase console.

Once all your configuration is complete run the following:

```sh
amplify push
```

Upon completion, `amplifyconfiguration.json` will be updated to reference the newly provisioned backend push notifications resources. Note that this file should already be generated for you by the Amplify CLI as a part of your project if you followed the [project setup walkthrough](/lib/project-setup/prereq).
