You can record receipt of a push notification with Amazon Pinpoint by calling `Amplify.Notifications.Push.recordNotificationReceived()` from the Messaging Service class.

<Callout>

You should call either `handleNotificationReceived` or `recordNotificationReceived`, but not both since `handleNotificationReceived` internally calls `recordNotificationReceived`.
