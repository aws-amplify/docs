The app badge count, when set, can be seen on your app's icon on a user's device. Amplify provides you with simple helpers to manipulate this number.

<Callout>
  App badge count helpers are safe to call even when your app is running on
  Android but will be ignored.

## Get the current badge count

Use `getBadgeCount` to get the current app badge count. You might need to do this to calculate the value to update the badge count to.

```js
const count = await Notifications.Push.getBadgeCount();
```

## Update the badge count

Use `setBadgeCount` to set the current app badge count. Setting the badge count to `0` (zero) will remove the badge from your app's icon.

```js
Notifications.Push.setBadgeCount(42);
```
