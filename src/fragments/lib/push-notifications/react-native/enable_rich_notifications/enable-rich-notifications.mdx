Amplify currently supports adding images to your notifications, but there are some additional steps required.

## Create a Notification Service Extension

1. Open `<your-app-name>.xcworkspace` located inside the `/ios` folder of your React Native project with Xcode.

2. In the Xcode project, select **File > New > Target...**

## Provide the extension with the Amplify service class

1. Open `Podfile` located inside the `/ios` folder of your React Native project with a text editor.

2. Add `AmplifyUtilsNotifications` to the extension you created above.

```ruby
target 'MyNotificationServiceExtension' do # Replace with your service extension
  pod "AmplifyUtilsNotifications"
end
```

3. Install the new pods by running the following command at the root of your React Native project.

```bash
npx pod-install
```

4. Open `<your-app-name>.xcworkspace` located inside the `/ios` folder of your React Native project with Xcode.

5. Find your extension folder in the Project navigator pane and select the **Info** Property List.
