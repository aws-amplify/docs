In your application directory, you should first install the necessary dependencies for using Push Notification.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/rtn-push-notification amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill
```

The AWS SDK requires React Native applications to polyfill `crypto.getRandomValues` and `URL`. Import it at the top of your application's root entry point (in most React Native apps this will be the top level `index.js`).

```js
// Example index.js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
...
```
