In your project directory, you should first install the necessary dependencies for using Amplify Push Notifications.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify@5.1.1 @aws-amplify/rtn-push-notification amazon-cognito-identity-js@6.2.0 @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill
```

You will also need to add the crypto.getRandomValues and URL polyfills to your application's entry point file (in most React Native apps this will be the top level `index.js`).

```js
// Example index.js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
...
```
