## Integrate native modules

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="iOS">

Since push notifications require interaction with the native platform, there are some additional steps required to integrate your React Native app with the Amplify Push Notification native module.

### Link the module
You should have already installed the native module in an earlier step, now you need to link it. In your React Native app's root directory run the following command.

```bash
npx pod-install
```

### Update your AppDelegate

Locate and open your `AppDelegate.m` or `AppDelegate.mm` file in your text editor. You should find it in your React Native project under `/ios/<YourProjectName>`

At the top of your AppDelegate, import Amplify Push Notification:

```objective-c
#import "AppDelegate.h"
#import "AmplifyPushNotification.h"

...
```

In the body of your AppDelegate, add the following two methods:

```objective-c
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
  [AmplifyPushNotification didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler {
  [AmplifyPushNotification didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}
```

There should be no additional integration steps after the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) have been completed.
