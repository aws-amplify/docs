Amplify reads configuration information at runtime from a file called `aws-exports.js`. If you used the Amplify CLI to create backend resources, this file was created for you. If it does not already exist, create the file and add it to the `src` folder in your React Native project.

Existing Amazon Pinpoint resources can be used with the Amplify Libraries by referencing your **Application ID** and **Region** in your `aws-exports` file.

```js
const awsmobile = {
  ...
  "Notifications": {
    "Push": {
      "AWSPinpoint": {
        "appId": "[APP ID]",
        "region": "[REGION]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **appId**: Amazon Pinpoint application ID
- **region**: AWS Region where the resources are provisioned (e.g. `us-east-1`)
