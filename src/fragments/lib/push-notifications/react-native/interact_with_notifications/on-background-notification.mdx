1. You should add this listener to your app's root entry point, i.e. _before_ registering your app component because it will be run via React Native's [Headless JS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/headless-js-android) and your app will not mount/render.
2. Notifications received in a terminated state will be considered low priority by Android unless you increase the priority of the payload by setting the `priority` to `high` (you will need to create a _Raw Message_ in Amazon Pinpoint to set this priority).
