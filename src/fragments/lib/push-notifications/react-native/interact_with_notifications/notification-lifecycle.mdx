## Notification lifecycle

Before delving into details about the various functions Amplify provides, it can be helpful to better understand the lifecycle of a notification as it moves through your app in its various states once you've integrated Amplify Push Notification.

For the purposes of this guide, we will simplify the terminology as follows

- **Native layer** - This is the native (i.e. iOS or Android) application layer on top of which React Native apps are built.
- **Application layer** - This is your React Native app.

### In a foreground state

- Notifications are not displayed when received in foreground
- It is possible for notifications to arrive in your user's notification center but not be opened until a later time
- Since it is possible to interact with the notification center at any time on a device, your user could even open a notification while your app is in the active foreground

### In a background state

- _Notification A_ represents an example of a notification which was received but never interacted with
- Recall that, in a background state, your app is still running and therefore does not need to be launched - only brought back into the foreground

### In a terminated state

- _Notification A_ represents an example of a notification which was received but never interacted with
- Recall that, in a terminated state, your app is no longer running and therefore needs to be launched
