Push Notifications are delivered via the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). In order to use APNs, you need to setup credentials (keys or certificates) and export your credentials to a p12 file. See [Setting up push notification services](/lib/push-notifications/setup-push-service) for more information.

Testing with APNs on the iOS simulator requires an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 13+, Xcode 14+, and iOS simulator 16+. If your development environment does not meet all these requirements, then you must run on a real device to get an APNs token.
