Once the user has granted permission to receive notifications and the device has been registered with APNs, the `application(_:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:)` delegate method of your Application Delegate will be called with the APNs token. You can use the `Amplify.Notifications.Push.registerDevice(apnsToken:)` method to register the device with Pinpoint.
