## Request user permission for notifications

Displaying push notifications from APNs requires requesting permission from the user to receive notifications and registering with the APNs service. 

**AWSPinpointPushNotificationsPlugin** takes care of registering with APNs during configuration. If you want the plugin to also request user permission during configuration, you can pass an array of `UNAuthorizationOptions` when adding the plugin. For example, to request permission for badges, alerts, and sounds, you could add the plugin with the following:
```
try Amplify.add(
    plugin: AWSPinpointPushNotificationsPlugin(options: [.badge, .alert, .sound])
)
```

If you don't pass `UNAuthorizationOptions` when adding the plugin, you will be responsible for requesting notification permissions and registering with APNs as shown below.

The following is only required when you do not pass `UNAuthorizationOptions` when adding the plugin as described above.
