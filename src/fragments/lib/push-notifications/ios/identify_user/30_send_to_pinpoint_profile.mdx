Alternatively, you can provide additional information about the user by passing a user profile:

```swift
let userProfile = BasicUserProfile(
    name: "Name",
    customProperties: [
        "attribute": "value"
    ]
)

try await Amplify.Notifications.Push.identifyUser(
    userId: user,
    userProfile: userProfile
)
```
