Setup instructions are provided for Android and iOS, and configuration for both platforms can be included on the same React Native project. 

## Requirements
1. In order to use Amazon Pinpoint you need to setup credentials (keys or certificates) for your targeted mobile platform, e.g. Android and/or iOS.
2. Testing Push Notifications requires a physical device, because simulators or emulators won't be able to handle push notifications.
3. Push Notifications category is integrated with [AWS Amplify Analytics category](/lib/analytics/getting-started) to be able to track notifications. Make sure that you have configured the Analytics category in your app before configuring the Push Notifications category.

## Setup for Android

1. Make sure you have a [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com) and app setup. 

2. Get your push messaging credentials for Android in Firebase console. [Click here for instructions](/sdk/push-notifications/setup-push-service).

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/pushnotification
    ```

4. Add your push messaging credentials (Server key) with Amplify CLI by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    amplify add notifications
    ```

    Choose *FCM* when promoted: 

    ```console
    ? Choose the push notification channel to enable.
    APNS
    ❯ FCM
    Email
    SMS
    ```

    The CLI will prompt for your *Firebase credentials*, enter them respectively.
    
    
    You can find said *Firebase credentials* by visiting https://console.firebase.google.com/project/[your-project-id]/settings/cloudmessaging or by navigating to (gear-next-to-project-name) > Project Settings > Cloud Messaging on the Firebase Console.

    Alternatively, you can set up Android push notifications in Amazon Pinpoint Console. [Click here for instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/mobile-push-android.html).

5. Enable your app in Firebase. To do that, follow those steps:

    <Callout>
        If you don't have an existing Firebase project, you need to create one in order to continue.
    </Callout>

    * Visit the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), and click the Gear icon next to **Project Overview** and click **Project Settings**. 
    * Click **Add App**, if you have an existing app you can skip this step
    * Choose **Add Firebase to your Android App**
    * Add your package name i.e. **com.myProjectName** and click **Register App**
    * Download  *google-services.json* file and copy it under your `android/app` project folder.
    
    <Callout warning>

    Make sure you have *google-services.json* file in place or you won't pass the build process.
    
    </Callout>

6. Open *android/build.gradle* file and perform following edits:

    - Add `classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3")` in the `dependencies` under `buildscript`:
        
    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        ...
        dependencies {
            ...
            classpath("com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3")
            ...
        }
    }
    ```

7. Open *android/app/build.gradle* and perform following edits:

    - Add firebase libs to the `dependencies` section:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        ...
        implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-core:15.0.2"
        implementation "com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:15.0.2"
        ...
    }
    ```
    - Add following configuration to the bottom of the file:

    ```gradle
    apply plugin: "com.google.gms.google-services"
    ``` 

8. Open *android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml* file and add the following configuration into `application` element.

    ```xml
    <application ... >

        <!--[START Push notification config -->
        <service
            android:name="com.amazonaws.amplify.pushnotification.RNPushNotificationMessagingService"
            android:exported="false">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </service>
        <!-- [END Push notification config -->

    </application>
    ```

9. Configure Push Notifications category for your app as shown in [Configure your App](#configure-your-app) section.

10. Run your app:

    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

## Setup for iOS

1. For setting up iOS push notifications, you need to download and install Xcode from [Apple Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

2. Setup iOS Push Notifications and create a p12 certificate as instructed here in [Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/apns-setup.html).

3. Install dependencies and CocoaPods:

    ```bash
    npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/pushnotification @react-native-community/push-notification-ios
    ```
    ```bash
    npx pod-install
    ```

4. Enable notifications and add your p12 certificate with Amplify CLI by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    amplify add notifications
    ```

    Choose *APNS* when promoted:

    ```console
    ? Choose the push notification channel to enable.
    > APNS
    FCM
    Email
    SMS
    ```

    Choose *Certificate* when promoted:

    ```console
    ? Choose authentication method used for APNs
    > Certificate
    Key
    ```

    The CLI will prompt for your *p12 certificate path*, enter it respectively.

5. Open project in Xcode and make updates for `@react-native-community/push-notification-ios`:
    - [Add Capabilities : Background Mode - Remote Notifications](https://github.com/react-native-community/push-notification-ios#add-capabilities--background-mode---remote-notifications)
    - [Augment `AppDelegate`](https://github.com/react-native-community/push-notification-ios#augment-appdelegate)

6. Update General App settings:

    - Set bundle identifier (with the one you create on your Apple Developer Account)
    - Make sure you have logged in with your Apple Developer account on Xcode and have a Team selected for the target.

7.  Configure Push Notification module for your app as shown in [Configure your App](#configure-your-app) section.

8. Run your app:

    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios --device
    ```

## Configure your App

The Push Notifications category is integrated with `Analytics` module to be able to track notifications. Make sure that you have configured the Analytics module in your app before configuring Push Notification module.  

<Callout>

If you don't have Analytics already enabled, see our [Analytics Developer Guide](/lib/analytics/getting-started) to add Analytics to your app.

</Callout>

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { PushNotification } from '@aws-amplify/pushnotification';
import PushNotificationIOS from '@react-native-community/push-notification-ios';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

### Configuration Options

- `requestIOSPermissions` is an optional boolean flag which specifies whether or not to automatically request push notifications permissions in iOS when calling `PushNotification.configure` for the first time. If not provided, it defaults to `true`. When set to `false`, you may later call the method `PushNotification.requestIOSPermissions` at the explicit point in your application flow when you want to prompt the user for permissions.
- `appId` is optional and *only* needed if `aws-exports` doesn't contain `aws_mobile_analytics_app_id` or you are manually configuring each category inside `Amplify.configure()`.

```javascript
Amplify.configure({
    ...awsconfig,
    PushNotification: {
        requestIOSPermissions: false
    }
});
```
```javascript
Amplify.configure({
    Auth: { /* ... */ },
    Analytics: { /* ... */ },
    PushNotification: {
        appId: 'XXXXXXXXXXabcdefghij1234567890ab',
        requestIOSPermissions: false
    }
});
```
