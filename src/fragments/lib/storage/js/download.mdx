## Get

Get a presigned URL of a stored file. You can specify some options: mainly [file access `level`](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/configureaccess/q/platform/js) and whether to `download` the file:

```typescript
await Storage.get(key: string, config: {
  level?: private | protected | public, // defaults to `public`
  identityId?: string, // id of another user, if `level: protected`
  download?: boolean, // defaults to false
  expires?: number, // validity of the URL, in seconds. defaults to 900 (15 minutes)
  contentType?: string // set return content type, eg "text/html"
});
```

`Storage.get` returns a signed URL `string` to your file, if `download` is false, which is the default. You can use this to create a download link for people to click on. This is our recommended option. Note that this method **does not check if the file actually exists** as that would involve an extra API call.

```js
// get the signed URL string
const signedURL = await Storage.get(key); // get key from Storage.list

// inside your template or JSX code. Note <a download> doesn't work here because it is not same origin
<a href={signedURL} target="_blank">{fileName}</a>
```

If `download` is true, `Storage.get` returns an object with a `Body` field of type [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob). It is up to you to programmatically save it to disk (we suggest a method below) or do whatever else you need with it.

### File download option

The `download` option send you the object data for download or programmatic manipulation:

```javascript
const result = await Storage.get(`filename.txt`, { download: true });

// data.Body is a Blob
result.Body.text().then(string => { 
  // handle the String data return String 
});
```

Note that the `Blob` methods like `.text()` are not supported on [IE/Opera/Safari](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/text); in those cases you can [parse manually](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob#JavaScript).

You can programmatically download Blobs using JavaScript:

```js
export function downloadBlob(blob, filename) {
  const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = url;
  a.download = filename || 'download';
  const clickHandler = () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
      a.removeEventListener('click', clickHandler);
    }, 150);
  };
  a.addEventListener('click', clickHandler, false);
  a.click();
  return a;
}

// usage
async function download() {
  const result = await Storage.get(fileKey, { download: true });
  downloadBlob(result.Body, 'filename');
}
```

The full return signature of `Storage.get(key, { download: true })` looks like this:

```js
{
  $metadata: {
    attempts: 1
    httpHeaders: {content-length: "388187", content-type: "audio/x-m4a", last-modified: "Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:29:13 GMT", x-amz-id-2: "/rRqsX/c2h5V00tYMtDY994wEenyPm0SDw1lyWyncWepyg+T6YJJSjLHKIsz0dxMI3kN5KjA6GQ=", â€¦}
    httpStatusCode: 200
    requestId: undefined
    totalRetryDelay: 0
  },
  Body: Blob {size: 388187, type: "audio/x-m4a"}, // this will vary
  ContentLength: 388187,
  ContentType: "audio/x-m4a",
  ETag: ""c05e324f61613c2472d47a8ee6fbb628"",
  LastModified: Fri Oct 09 2020 22:29:13 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time) {},
  Metadata: {},
  __type: "GetObjectOutput",
}
```

### Monitor progress of download

To track the progress of your download, you can use `progressCallback`:

```javascript
Storage.get('filename.txt', {
	download: true,
	progressCallback(progress) {
		console.log(`Downloaded: ${progress.loaded}/${progress.total}`);
	}
})
```

### File Access Levels

You can choose to configure access level ahead of time, or at the point of calling `Storage.get`:

```javascript
// Option 1: configure access ahead of time
Storage.configure({ level: 'private' });
const result = await Storage.get('welcome.png'); // Gets the welcome.png belonging to current user

// Option 2: configure access inside the call
const result = await Storage.get('welcome.png', { level: 'private' }); // same effect
```

Here is a quick guide to the access levels - [see the docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/storage/configureaccess/q/platform/js) for more detail:

- `public`: Accessible by all users of your app. Files are stored under the `public/` path in your S3 bucket.
- `protected`: Readable by all users, but writable only by the creating user. Files are stored under `protected/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

```javascript
// To get current user's objects
const result = await Storage.get('filename.txt', { level: 'protected' });

// To get other users' objects
const result = await Storage.get('filename.txt', { 
    level: 'protected', 
    identityId: 'xxxxxxx' // the identityId of that user
});
```
- `private`: **Only accessible for the signed in user**. Files are stored under `private/{user_identity_id}/` where the `user_identity_id` corresponds to the unique Amazon Cognito Identity ID for that user.

### Download expiry

You can use `expires` option to limit the availability of your URLs. This configuration returns the pre-signed URL that expires in 60 seconds:

```javascript
await Storage.get('filename.txt', { expires: 60 });
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

Users can run into unexpected issues, so we are giving you advance notice in documentation with links to open issues - please vote for what you need, to help the team prioritize.

- Very common issue: Calling `Storage.get` for a nonexistent file, or incorrect credentials, **does not throw an error** because that would involve an extra API call. [Active issue here](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/1145). If you are having trouble accessing a file, make sure to check that you have the right filename, bucket, region, and auth configs. You can get a current list of files from `Storage.list`.
- `Storage.get` is cached; if you have recently modified a file you may not get the most recent version right away. [There is an active issue for a new option to enable cache busting.](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/6413)
- `Storage.get` only returns the latest cached version of the file; there is [not yet an API to view prior versions](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/2131).
- Download progress tracking is not yet possible. [Active issue here](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/4734).
- You cannot [only get file metadata](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/6157) yet.
- [Image compression](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/6081) or CloudFront CDN caching for your S3 buckets is not yet possible.
- There is no API for [Cognito Group-based access to files](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/3388).
- There is currently [no API for getting the identityId of other users](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues/5177); you have to retrieve this from elsewhere before calling `Storage.get`.
