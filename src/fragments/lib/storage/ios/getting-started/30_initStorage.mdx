To use the Amplify Storage and Authentication categories in your app, you need to create and configure their corresponding plugins by calling the `Amplify.add(plugin:)` and `Amplify.configure()` methods.

<Block name="SwiftUI">

Add the following imports to the top of your `App` scene and configure Amplify in the `init`:
```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSS3StoragePlugin

@main
struct MyAmplifyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }

    init() { 
        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSS3StoragePlugin())
            try Amplify.configure()
            print("Amplify configured with Auth and Storage plugins")
        } catch {
            print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="UIKit">

Add the following imports to the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSS3StoragePlugin
```

Add the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSS3StoragePlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with Auth and Storage plugins")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

</Block>

Upon building and running this application you should see the following in your console window:

```console
Amplify configured with Auth and Storage plugins
```
