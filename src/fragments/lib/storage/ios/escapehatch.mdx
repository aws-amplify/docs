For advanced use cases where Amplify does not provide the functionality, you can retrieve the escape hatch to access the AWSS3 instance.

<Callout warning>

**Note:** While the Amplify Library for Swift is production ready, please note that the underlying AWS SDK for Swift is currently in Developer Preview, and is not yet intended for production workloads. [Here is additional reading material](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift/blob/main/docs/stability.md) on the stability of the SDK

</Callout>

Add the following import:


```swift
import AWSS3StoragePlugin
```

Then retrieve the escape hatch with this code

```swift
do {
    // Retrieve the reference to AWSS3StoragePlugin
    let plugin = try Amplify.Storage.getPlugin(for: "awsS3StoragePlugin")
    guard let storagePlugin = plugin as? AWSS3StoragePlugin else {
        return
    }
    
    // Retrieve the reference to S3Client
    let s3Client = storagePlugin.getEscapeHatch()

    // Make requests using s3Client...
    // ...
} catch {
    print("Get escape hatch failed with error - \(error)")
}
```
