If you are using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used with the Amplify Libraries by running:

```bash
amplify import storage
```

For more details, see how to [Use an existing S3 bucket or DynamoDB table](/cli/storage/import).

If you are not using the Amplify CLI, an existing Amazon S3 bucket can be used by referencing it in your `amplifyconfiguration` file.

<Callout warning>
  When you are not using Amplify CLI, adding existing Amazon S3 bucket to your
  application may require configuring bucket access permissions. e.g. Enabling
  read/write access to the cognito user pool that you are using with the Amplify
  Auth category.
</Callout>

```json
{
  "storage": {
    "plugins": {
      "awsS3StoragePlugin": {
        "bucket": "[BUCKET NAME]",
        "region": "[REGION]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- **bucket**: Name of the bucket to use for storage
- **region**: AWS Region where the bucket is provisioned (e.g. _us-east-1_)
  <!-- TODO Rewrite need to add a section for configuring the Amplify libraries for JS+React Native -->

Note that before you can add an AWS resource to your application, the application must have the Amplify libraries installed. If you need to perform this step, see [Install Amplify Libraries](/lib/project-setup/create-application#n2-install-amplify-libraries).
