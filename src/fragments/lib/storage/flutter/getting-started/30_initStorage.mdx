To initialize the Amplify Auth and Storage categories, call `Amplify.addPlugin()` for each plugin or pass all the plugins in `Amplify.addPlugins()`. To complete initialization, call `Amplify.configure()`.

```dart
// Add this line, to include Auth and Storage plugins.
await Amplify.addPlugins([AmplifyAuthCognito(), AmplifyStorageS3()]);
// ... add other plugins, if any
await Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
```
