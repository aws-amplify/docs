To delete an object uploaded to S3, use `Amplify.Storage.remove` and by specifying its key:

```dart
Future<void> deleteFile(String key) async {
  try {
    final result = await Amplify.Storage.remove(key: key);
    print('Deleted file: ${result.key}');
  } on StorageException catch (e) {
    print('Error deleting file: $e');
  }
}
```
