## Set up the backend

If you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the *default configuration*).

Run `amplify add predictions` and select **Convert**. Then use the following answers:

```console
? What would you like to convert? (Use arrow keys)
  Translate text into a different language 
> Generate speech audio from text 
  Transcribe text from audio 
  
? Who should have access? Auth and Guest users
```

Now run `amplify push` which will generate your `aws-exports.js` and create resources in the cloud. You can now either add this to your backend or skip and add more features to your app.

## Working with the API

Generate an audio buffer for playback from a text input.

```javascript
Predictions.convert({
  textToSpeech: {
    source: {
      text: textToGenerateSpeech
    },
    voiceId: "Amy" // default configured on aws-exports.js 
    // list of different options are here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html
  }
})
.then(result => console.log({ result }))
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```
