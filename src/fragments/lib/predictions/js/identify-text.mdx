## Set up the backend

If you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the _default configuration_).

Run `amplify add predictions` and select **Identify**. Then use the following answers:

```console
? What would you like to identify? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Identify Text
  Identify Entities
  Identify Labels
  Learn More

? Would you also like to identify documents? Yes
? Who should have access? Auth and Guest users
```

**NOTE:** Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/12159), you will need to update your amplify backend configuration with the properties below before pushing to the cloud:

**amplify/backend/identify-text-resource/parameters.json**

```json
"identifyDoc": true,
"access": "auth | authAndGuest",
"format": "PLAIN | FORM | TABLE | ALL"
```

Now run `amplify push` which will generate your `amplifyconfiguration.json` and create resources in the cloud. You can now either add this to your backend or skip and add more features to your app.

Services used: Amazon Rekognition (default for plain text) and Amazon Textract (default for documents)

## Working with the API

Detect text in an input image. Input can be sent directly from the browser or an Amazon S3 key from project bucket.

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    }
  }
});
console.log({ response });
```

## Identify image stored in Amazon S3

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      key: pathToPhoto,
      level?: 'guest' | 'private' | 'protected', //optional, default is configured on Storage category
    }
  }
})
console.log({ response });
```

> The following options are independent of which `source` is specified. For demonstration purposes we will reference a `file` but it can be an S3 Key as well. `Predictions.identify({text : {...}})` can detect unstructured text `PLAIN`, structured text from tables `TABLE` or text from forms `FORM`.

## Identify plain text

For detecting plain text, you can see the whole detected text, the lines detected, the position of each line of text, and each word.

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: 'PLAIN'
  }
});

const {
  text: {
    fullText, // String
    lines, // Array of String ordered from top to bottom
    linesDetailed /* Array of objects that contains
        text, // String
        boundingBox: {
          width, // ratio of overall image width
          height, // ratio of overall image height
          left, // left coordinate as a ratio of overall image width
          top // top coordinate as a ratio of overall image height
        },
        polygon // Array of { x, y } coordinates as a ratio of overall image width and height
        */,
    words // Array of objects that contains { text, boundingBox, polygon}
  }
} = response;
```

## Identify structured forms

For detecting structured forms (documents, tables, etc.) from an image, `keyValues` will return a string of the entity found in the image as well as metadata such as selected checkboxes or the relative location in the image using a `boundingBox`.

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: 'FORM'
  }
});

const {
  text: {
    // same as PLAIN +
    keyValues // Array of { key: string, value: { text: string, selected: boolean}, polygon, boundingBox }
  }
} = response;
```

For example the below image would return `keyValues` with "Test" or "Checked" as a key, and `true` since they are selected. The location of these elements would be returned in the `boundingBox` value.

## Identify structured tables

For detecting structured tables from an image

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: 'TABLE'
  }
});

const {
  text: {
    // same as PLAIN +
    tables: [
      {
        size: { rows, columns },
        table // Matrix Array[ Array ] of size rows
        // each element of the array contains { text, boundingBox, polygon, selected, rowSpan, columnSpan}
      }
    ]
  }
} = response;
```

For detecting tables and forms on the image just select format "ALL"

```javascript
import { Predictions } from '@aws-amplify/predictions';

const response = await Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: 'ALL'
  }
});

const {
  text: {
    // same as PLAIN + FORM + TABLE
  }
} = response;
```
