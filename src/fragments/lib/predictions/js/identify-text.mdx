## Set up the backend

If you haven't already done so, run `amplify init` inside your project and then `amplify add auth` (we recommend selecting the *default configuration*).

Run `amplify add predictions` and select **Identify**. Then use the following answers:

```console
? What would you like to identify? (Use arrow keys)
❯ Identify Text 
  Identify Entities 
  Identify Labels 
  Learn More 

? Would you also like to identify documents? Yes
? Who should have access? Auth and Guest users
```

Due to a [known issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/issues/12159), you will need to update your amplify backend configuration with the properties below before pushing to the cloud:

```json
// amplify/.backend/identifyText#####/parameters.json
"identifyDoc": true | false,
"access": "auth" | authAndGuest,
"format": "PLAIN" | "FORM" | "TABLE" | "ALL"
```

Now run `amplify push` which will generate your `aws-exports.js` and create resources in the cloud. You can now either add this to your backend or skip and add more features to your app.

Services used: Amazon Rekognition (default for plain text) and Amazon Textract (default for documents)

## Working with the API 

Detect text in an input image. Input can be sent directly from the browser or an Amazon S3 key from project bucket.

```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    }
  }
})
.then(response => console.log({ response }))
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```

## Identify image stored in Amazon S3

```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      key: pathToPhoto,
      level?: 'guest' | 'private' | 'protected', //optional, default is configured on Storage category
    }
  }
})
.then((response) => console.log({ response }))
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```

> The following options are independent of which `source` is specified. For demonstration purposes we will reference a `file` but it can be an S3 Key as well. `Predictions.identify({text : {...}})` can detect unstructured text `PLAIN`, structured text from tables `TABLE` or text from forms `FORM`.

## Identify plain text

For detecting plain text, you can see the whole detected text, the lines detected, the position of each line of text, and each word.

```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: "PLAIN", 
  }
})
.then(response => {
  const {
    text: {
      fullText, // String
      lines, // Array of String ordered from top to bottom
      linesDetailed, /* Array of objects that contains
          text, // String
          boundingBox: {
            width, // ratio of overall image width
            height, // ratio of overall image height
            left, // left coordinate as a ratio of overall image width
            top // top coordinate as a ratio of overall image height
          },
          polygon // Array of { x, y } coordinates as a ratio of overall image width and height
          */  
      words // Array of objects that contains { text, boundingBox, polygon} 
    }
  } = response
})
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```

## Identify structured forms

For detecting structured forms (documents, tables, etc.) from an image, `keyValues` will return a string of the entity found in the image as well as metadata such as selected checkboxes or the relative location in the image using a `boundingBox`.

```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: "FORM", 
  }
})
.then(response => {
  const {
    text: { 
      // same as PLAIN +
      keyValues  // Array of { key (String), value: { text (String), selected (boolean)}, polygon, boundingBox } 
    }    
  } = response
})
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```

For example the below image would return `keyValues` with "Test" or "Checked" as a key, and `true` since they are selected. The location of these elements would be returned in the `boundingBox` value.

## Identify structured tables

For detecting structured tables from an image
```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: "TABLE", 
  }
})
.then(response => {
  const {
    text: { 
      // same as PLAIN +
      tables : [
        {
          size: { rows, columns }, 
          table // Matrix Array[ Array ] of size rows
          // each element of the array contains { text, boundingBox, polygon, selected, rowSpan, columnSpan}
        }
      ]
    }    
  } = response
})
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```

For detecting tables and forms on the image just select format "ALL"
```javascript
Predictions.identify({
  text: {
    source: {
      file
    },
    format: "ALL", 
  }
})
.then(response => {
  const {
    text: { 
      // same as PLAIN + FORM + TABLE
    }    
  } = response
})
.catch(err => console.log({ err }));
```
