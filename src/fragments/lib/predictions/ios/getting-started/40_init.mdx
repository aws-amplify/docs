To initialize the Amplify Predictions and Authentication categories, you are required to use the `Amplify.add()` method for each category you want.  When you are done calling `add()` on each category, you finish configuring Amplify by calling `Amplify.configure()`.

**Add the following imports** to the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` file:
```swift
import Amplify
import AmplifyPlugins
import AWSPredictionsPlugin
```

**Add the following code**

<BlockSwitcher>

<Block name="SwiftUI">

Create a custom `AppDelegate`, and add to your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method
```swift
class AppDelegate: NSObject, UIApplicationDelegate {
    func application(
        _ application: UIApplication,
        didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
    ) -> Bool {

        do {
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
            try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSPredictionsPlugin())
            try Amplify.configure()
            print("Amplify configured with Auth and Predictions plugins")
        } catch {
            print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
        }

        return true
    }
}
```

Then in the `App` scene, use `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor` property wrapper to use your custom `AppDelegate`
```swift
@main
struct MyAmplifyApp: App {
    @UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor(AppDelegate.self) var appDelegate

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="UIKit">

Add to your AppDelegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {

    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSPredictionsPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with Auth and Predictions plugins")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

</Block>

</BlockSwitcher>

Upon building and running this application you should see the following in your console window:

```bash
Amplify configured with Auth and Predictions plugins
```
