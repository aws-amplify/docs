SSR functionality in Amplify was primarily built for compatibility with Next.js [page components](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages), and their [getServerSideProps data fetching mechanism](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props). Compatibility with other frameworks or Next.js features cannot be guaranteed.
