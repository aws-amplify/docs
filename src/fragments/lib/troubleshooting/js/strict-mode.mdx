This section lists known TypeScript errors and their workarounds when [strict mode](/lib/troubleshooting/strict-mode/q/platform/js/) is enabled on your application.

## Declaration file for GraphQL

If you see the error

```
Could not find a declaration file for module 'graphql/error/GraphQLError'` 
Could not find a declaration file for module 'graphql/language/ast'` 
```

Add a declaration file `src/types.d.ts` with the following content to resolve the error:

```ts
declare module 'graphql/language/ast' { export type DocumentNode = any }
declare module 'graphql/error/GraphQLError' { export type GraphQLError = any }
```

## Declaration file for aws-exports

If you see the error

```
Could not find a declaration file for module './aws-exports'. 'aws-exports.js' implicitly has an 'any' type.
```

Create a `aws-exports.d.ts` file on the same level as `aws-exports` with the following content:

```ts
declare const awsmobile: Record<string, any>
export default awsmobile; 
```

## Storage Type Error

If you see the error

```
TS2344: Type 'T[U]' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'
TS2344: Type 'T[api]' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
```

You can resolve this by setting [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#strictNullChecks) to false within your `tsconfig.json`.
