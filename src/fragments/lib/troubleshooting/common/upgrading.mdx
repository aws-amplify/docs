This migration guide will help you upgrade your Amplify JavaScript project from v5 to v6. In order to provide you with a cleaner experience, better typings, improved support for NextJS, and improved [tree-shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) leading to [a much smaller bundle-size](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/building-fast-next-js-apps-using-typescript-and-aws-amplify-javascript-v6), we made the following changes for v6:

1. We have transitioned to an approach where you only import the features you need from each of our categories.
2. Most API’s now use named params instead of positional params, allowing for cleaner and more consistent typing.
3. We have enabled typescript strict mode on all categories and have added typing to help make it easier to connect your backend resources if you have chosen not to use the Amplify CLI.

Below is an example of how you would have previously interacted with the Amplify JavaScript library in v5.

```ts
import { CognitoUser } from '@aws-amplify/auth';
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

const handleSignIn = async ({
  username,
  password
}: {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}) => {
  const user: CognitoUser = Auth.signIn(username, password);
};
```

The following is an example of how you would accomplish the same functionality with v6, using our new imports and API surface.

```ts
import { signIn } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

const handleSignIn = async ({
  username,
  password
}: {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}) => {
  const { isSignUpComplete, userId, nextStep } = signIn({ username, password });
};
```

## Changes to React Native

As part of the updates to Amplify JavaScript v6, we also re-evaluated our strategy for how we can best support React Native going forward. This has been an ongoing effort ever since we introduced our updated Push Notification experience in v5 and is something we will continue to evolve along with the ever-changing React Native ecosystem.

### @aws-amplify/react-native

We have introduced a new package - `@aws-amplify/react-native` - to encompass the core requirements for using Amplify JavaScript v6 in a React Native environment. This package is a new requirement which allows us to:

- Remove the dependency on the `amazon-cognito-identity-js` package by moving core native Amplify functionality previously vended by this package into `@aws-amplify/react-native`.
- Automatically install JavaScript-only (i.e. non-native module dependencies) polyfills required by Amplify as transitive dependencies, no longer requiring extra steps from you.
- Automatically import all required polyfills, no longer requiring you to take extra steps to include import statements at the top of your application entry point.

> Native modules required by Amplify such as `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` or `react-native-get-random-values` still need to be installed separately as they need to be linked with React Native

### Dropping support for Expo Go

With the goal of providing more idiomatic native functionality to your React Native application, Expo Go will no longer be supported in v6.

Per the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/):

> The Expo Go app is a great tool to get started. It exists to help developers quickly get projects off the ground, experiment with ideas (such as on Snack), and share their work with minimal friction. Expo Go makes this possible by including a feature-rich native runtime made up of every module in the Expo SDK, so all you need to do to use a module is install the package and reload your app. <br/><br/> The tradeoff is that Expo Go does not allow you to add custom native code. You can only use native modules built into the Expo SDK. Many great libraries are available outside of the Expo SDK, and you may even want to build your native library. You can leverage these libraries with development builds or using prebuild to generate native projects, or both. You can also continue using EAS Build to release your app as no changes are required.

A key part of Amplify's React Native strategy going forward is to reduce our reliance on third-party native modules. While third-party native modules are a mainstay of the React Native ecosystem, we believe the flexibility of building more native modules tailored to the specific needs of our customers will allow us to most quickly deliver value to them in the long run. As a result of now requiring native modules not available through the Expo SDK, Expo Go is not supported in v6 but you should be able to use Expo.

## Step 1: Upgrade your dev environment

In order to use Amplify JavaScript v6, you will need to make sure you are using the following versions in your development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16.x or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v9.7.1 or later

## Step 2: Upgrade your Amplify project dependencies

<Callout>Make sure to delete your package-lock.json and node_modules folder before running `npm install`</Callout>

<InlineFilter filters={['angular', 'javascript', 'vue', 'react']}>

Upgrade to the latest Amplify library using the following command:

```
npm install aws-amplify@6
```

The `aws-amplify` package in v6 includes the categories below:

- Auth
- API
- Storage
- Analytics
- DataStore
- In-App Messaging

If you previously listed `@aws-amplify` namespaced packages for the above categories as dependencies in your `package.json`, you will need to remove them to avoid dependency duplication.

If you would like to use Geo, Predictions, PubSub, or Interactions you will need to install those packages separately. (see [category-specific migration instructions](/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/migrate-from-javascript-v5-to-v6/#4-upgrade-category-usage))

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['react-native']}>

<Callout>The `aws-amplify-react-native` package is not compatible with v6.</Callout>

To upgrade React Native projects that do not utilize `aws-amplify-react-native`, remove `amazon-cognito-identity-js` from the project _package.json_ and install `@aws-amplify/react-native`.

Then upgrade/install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install aws-amplify@6 @aws-amplify/react-native @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values
```

Note that v6 supports react-native v0.70+, so if you prefer manually upgrading dependencies double-check the version of react-native in your package.json file.

`@aws-amplify/react-native` requires a minimum iOS deployment target of `13.0`, if it has not already been set to `13.0` or above, open the _Podfile_ located in the _ios_ directory and update the `target` value:

```diff
- platform :ios, min_ios_version_supported
+ platform :ios, 13.0
```

<Callout>
  If you are using `signInWithRedirect` (previously `Auth.federatedSignIn`) you will need to install the `@aws-amplify/rtn-web-browser` native module.

  If you are using Push Notifications, you will need to upgrade the `@aws-amplify/rtn-push-notification` native module to v1.2+ (if you were using push notifications in v5, this dependency should already be added). Find all Push Notifications API changes in its [migration guide](/react-native/build-a-backend/push-notifications/push-notifications-migration-guide/)

</Callout>

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={['nextjs']}>

Upgrade/install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```
npm install aws-amplify@6 @aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs
```

The `@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs` package provides adapter functions to enable use of Amplify APIs on the server side of your Next.js app for use cases such as Server Side Rendering (SSR) with the App Router.

Note that v6 supports NextJS v13.5.0 through 14. We recommend upgrading if you are using a version below  13.5.0.

<Callout>NextJS v13.5.0 requires Node v16.14.0 or later and NextJS v14+ requires Node v18.17.0 or later</Callout>

</InlineFilter>

## Step 3: Upgrade Amplify CLI version and configuration file

If you created your project with Amplify CLI version < 12.5.1, upgrade your CLI version and regenerate your configuration file using the scripts below.

```
amplify upgrade
amplify push
```

This will generate a new configuration file called `amplifyconfiguration.json`

Wherever you called `Amplify.configure({ aws-exports });` previously (usually in the root of your project) update your code as shown below

<Columns columns={2}>
  <div>
    **V5**
    ```
    import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

    Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
    ```

  </div>
  <div>
    **V6**
    ```
    import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';

    Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
    ```

  </div>
</Columns>

<Callout>
  `Amplify.configure()` will now accept either the config JSON file or a strongly typed configuration object. Therefore, if you need to add additional configuration, you will call configure twice: once with the contents of **amplifyconfiguration.json**, and then again using `Amplify.getConfig()` plus any additions. Keep in mind that any call to configuration will fully override previous configurations, so pay special attention to nested configurations.
</Callout>

If you have previously configured Amplify by passing the configuration object literal when calling the `Amplify.configure()` function, you can now configure Amplify manually with type safety. Please refer to the documentation of each category that you are using for migration.

### Running Amplify on the server with NextJS

To enable the use of the Amplify JavaScript library on the server, you need to set the `ssr` configuration to true in the `Amplify.configure` function.

```
Amplify.configure(amplifyConfig, {
  ssr: true
});
```

</InlineFilter>

<InlineFilter filters={["react-native"]}>

### Remove polyfill imports

For React Native applications, polyfill imports should no longer need to be added to your application's entry point file as they are imported by the `@aws-amplify/react-native` package.

```diff
// Example index.js
- import 'react-native-get-random-values';
- import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
```

## Step 4: Update category usage

### Auth

<Callout>Find a comprehensive summary of changes to the Auth category in the [Auth migration guide](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/auth-migration-guide/)</Callout>

As of v6 of Amplify, you will now import the functional API’s directly from the `aws-amplify/auth` path as shown below. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="V5">
    ```ts
    import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

    async function signIn() {
      try {
        const user = await Auth.signIn(username, password);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('error signing in', error);
      }
    }

    async function signOut() {
      try {
        await Auth.signOut();
      } catch (error) {
        console.log('error signing out: ', error);
      }
    }
    ```

  </Block>
  <Block name="V6">
    ```ts
    import { signIn, signOut } from 'aws-amplify/auth';

    async function signIn({ username, password }) {
      try {

### Analytics

<Callout>Find a comprehensive summary of changes to the Analytics category in the [Analytics migration guide](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/analytics/analytics-migration-guide/)</Callout>

As of v6 of Amplify, you will now import the functional API’s directly from the `aws-amplify/analytics` path as shown below. Note that in v6, the provider is determined by import path. The functions exported from `aws-amplify/analytics` use AWS Pinpoint. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="V5">
    ```ts
    import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';

    Analytics.record({
      name: 'albumVisit',
      attributes: { genre: '', artist: '' },
      metrics: { minutesListened: 30 }
    });

    Analytics.autoTrack('session', {
      enable: true,
      attributes: {
        customizableField: 'attr'
      },
      provider: 'AWSPinpoint'
    });

### API (GraphQL)

As of v6 of Amplify, you will now import a function called `generateClient` from the `aws-amplify/api` path and use the `client` returned from that method to perform graphql operations as shown below. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="V5">
    ```ts
    import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify';
    import { createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo } from './graphql/mutations';

      description: 'Hello world!'
    };

    /* create a todo */
    const newTodo = await API.graphql(
      graphqlOperation(createTodo, {

### In-App Messaging

<Callout>Find a comprehensive summary of changes to In-App Messaging in the [In-App Messaging migration guide](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/in-app-messaging/in-app-messaging-migration-guide/)</Callout>

As of v6 of Amplify, you will now import the functional API’s directly from the `aws-amplify/in-app-messaging` path as shown below. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

<BlockSwitcher>
  <Block name="V5">
    ```
    import { Notifications } from 'aws-amplify';

### Interactions

To use Interactions in v6, you will first need to install the category as a separate dependency using the below command:

```sh
npm install @aws-amplify/interactions
```

<Callout>
  Make sure that the @aws-amplify/interactions package has the same version number as the aws-amplify package in your package.json file.
</Callout>

In v6, the `AWSLexV2Provider` provider will be included by default and you are no longer required to call `Amplify.addPluggable`. It is also recommended to integrate your App with AWS LexV2, as the default module exports are associated with AWS LexV2 APIs. Interactions operates in the same way as before, however, the configuration structure has changed somewhat. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

### PubSub

As of v6 of Amplify, you will now import the functional API’s directly from the `aws-amplify/pubsub` path as shown below. Use the switcher below to see the differences between v5 and v6:

  <Block name="V5">
    ```
    import { Amplify, PubSub } from 'aws-amplify';

In V6 we’ve audited our hub events and removed some events and categories to reduce redundancies and the overall chattiness of the hub. The Storage, In-App Messaging, and Push Notifications categories no longer emit Hub events. You can track the status of calls to those categories via API responses.

Expand the sections below to see the events that have been changed or removed. There have been no changes to API, DataStore, and PubSub events.

### Server-side Rendering

<Callout>Find a comprehensive summary of changes to Server-Side Rendering in the [NextJS migration guide](/nextjs/build-a-backend/server-side-rendering/nextjs-v5-to-v6-migration-guide/)</Callout>

The Amplify JS v5 `withSSRContext` utility is no longer available with Amplify JS v6. You will need to use the `runWithAmplifyServerContext` function exported from `@aws-amplify/adapter-nextjs` to use Amplify categories on the server side of your Next.js app. 

> Note: DataStore is no longer supported in an SSR context: if you are using DataStore within your SSR project, you will need to migrate to the API category. For details on how to accomplish this, see the [NextJS migration guide: Migrating from DataStore to API in a server context](/[platform]/build-a-backend/server-side-rendering/nextjs-v5-to-v6-migration-guide/#migrating-from-datastore-to-graphql-api-client-in-a-server-context)
