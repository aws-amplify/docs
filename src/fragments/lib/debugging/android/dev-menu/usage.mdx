Shake the device to access the developer menu during a debug build of your app. An emulator can be shaken by selecting the more option (denoted by three dots) next to the emulator, navigating to the “Virtual Sensors” tab, clicking the “Move” button, and then moving the emulator shown within the “Virtual Sensors” tab back and forth a few times.
