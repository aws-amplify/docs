In your mobile app, create and add a `amplifyconfiguration_logging.json` to the same location as the `amplifyconfiguration.json` file.  Ensure that the file is included in the `Copy Bundle Resources` build phase.

The `<log-group-name>` and `<region>` is the value you specified in the CDK construct as part of provisioning your backend resources.  These values can also be found at the end of the output logs when deploying the sample CDK construct.  The configuration file is the data source for the logging plugin to know where, when and what logs to sends.  The example below configures the logging plugin to automatically send all logs at log level `ERROR` at 60 seconds interval and store logs locally up to 1MB.

```json
{
    "awsCloudWatchLoggingPlugin": {
        "enable": true,
        "logGroupName": "<log-group-name>",
        "region": "<region>",
        "localStoreMaxSizeInMB": 1,
        "flushIntervalInSeconds": 60,
        "loggingConstraints": {
            "defaultLogLevel": "ERROR"
        }
    }
}
```

To use the Amplify Logger and Amplify Auth categories in your app, you need to create and configure their corresponding plugins by calling the `Amplify.add(plugin:)` and `Amplify.configure()` methods.

Add the following imports to the top of your main `App` file:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSCloudWatchLoggingPlugin
```

Add the following code to its initializer. If there is none, you can create a default `init`. When Amplify initializes the logging plugin, it will automatically find and load the configuration in the `amplifyconfiguration_logging.json` that is bundled with your app.

```swift
init() {
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCloudWatchLoggingPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
    } catch {
        assert(false, "Error initializing Amplify: \(error)")
    }
}
```
