To use the Amplify Logger and Amplify Auth categories in your app, you need to create and configure their corresponding plugins by calling the `Amplify.add(plugin:)` and `Amplify.configure()` methods.

Add the following imports to the top of your main `App` file:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSCloudWatchLoggingPlugin
```

Add the following code to its initializer. If there is none, you can create a default `init`:

```swift
init() {
    do {
        let loggingConfiguration = AWSCloudWatchLoggingPluginConfiguration(logGroupName: "<log-group-name>", region: "<region>")
        let loggingPlugin = AWSCloudWatchLoggingPlugin(loggingPluginConfiguration: loggingConfiguration)
        try Amplify.add(plugin: loggingPlugin)
        try Amplify.configure()
    } catch {
        assert(false, "Error initializing Amplify: \(error)")
    }
}
```

The `<log-group-name>` and `region` is the value you specified in the CDK construct as part of provisioning your AWS backend resources.  The example below configures the logging plugin to automatically send all logs at log level `ERROR` at 60 seconds interval and store logs locally up to 1MB.
