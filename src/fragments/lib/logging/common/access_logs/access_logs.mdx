Log messages are sent to the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you created and specified in the [initial set up](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/logging/set-up-logging/). Each user log messages can be found in user-specific log stream in the log group. Log stream names are generated based on the user's device identifier and a user identifier.
For an authenticated user, the log stream name is `<device-identifier>.<user-identifier>`.  For an unauthenticated user, the log stream name is `<device-identifier>.guest`.

The device identifier is the unique identifier provided by the user's hardware device and OS. You can use the Amplify Auth category to [retrieve the user identifier](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/logging/configure-user/#retrieve-userids-with-amplify-auth) for a specific user if needed. You can also retrieve the user identifier by visiting the Amazon Cognito console and inspecting the `User ID` in User pools.
