With the Amplify Logger, you can send logs to Amazon CloudWatch from errors that are caught by the Amplify library or by adding your own custom log messages. For the Amplify library and custom logs you can customize which levels to log to CloudWatch.
## Log messages
You can log messages using the Amplify logger to a specific namespace to help you group logs that are similar when they are sent to CloudWatch. To accomplish this, get an instance of the `Logger` and specifying a `category name` and/or `namespace`.  Use the `Logger` instance to log messages at the desired log level.  The `category name` and `namespace` values are used to tag your log messages that will appear in CloudWatch.  It is also use to identify and fetch the logger again without creating a new `Logger` instance.

You can also log JSON formatted log messages to leverage [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) query and filter supports.

You should follow best security practices when logging messages.  This includes validating log messages and ensuring log messages don't contain personally identifiable information and/or sensitive data.
