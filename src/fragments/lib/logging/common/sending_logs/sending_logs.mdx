The Amplify library already uses the Amplify Logger internally.  Each Amplify feature logs messages at various log levels.  You can log your own custom messages and various log levels depending on your use cases.  Only log levels that are the same or below the log level defined in the logging constraints are sent to Amazon CloudWatch.

## Log an message
Get an instance of the `Logger` and specifying a `category name` and/or `namespace`.  Use the `Logger` instance to log messages at the desired log level.  The `category name` and `namespace` values are used to tag your log messages that will appear in CloudWatch.  It is also use to identify and fetch the logger again without creating a new `Logger` instance.

You can also log JSON formatted log messages to leverage [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AnalyzingLogData.html) query and filter supports.

You should follow best security practices when logging messages.  This includes validating log messages and ensuring log messages don't contain personally identifiable information and/or sensitive data.
