Analytics Auto Tracking helps you to automatically track user behaviors like sessions start/stop, page view change and web events like clicking or mouseover.
<Callout>
  The Auto Tracking feature is only supported when you have Amazon Pinpoint configured for Amplify Analytics.

## Session Tracking

You can track the session both in a web app or a React Native app by using Analytics. A web session can be defined in different ways. To keep it simple we define a web session as being active when the page is not hidden and inactive when the page is hidden.
A session in a React Native app is active when the app is in the foreground and inactive when the app is in the background.

For example:
```javascript
import { configureAutoTrack } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

configureAutoTrack({
  // REQUIRED, turn on/off the auto tracking
  enable: true,
  // REQUIRED, the event type, it's one of 'event', 'pageView' or 'session'
  type: 'session',
  // OPTIONAL, additional options for the tracked event.
  options: {
    // OPTIONAL, the attributes of the event
    attributes: {
      customizableField: 'attr'
    }
  }
});
```

By default, when the page/app transitions to the foreground, the Analytics module will send an event to the Amazon Pinpoint Service.
```json
{
  "eventType": "_session_start",
  "attributes": {
    "customizableField": "attr"
  }
}
```

This behavior can be disabled by calling `configureAutoTrack`:
```javascript
import { configureAutoTrack } from 'aws-amplify/analytics';

configureAutoTrack({
  enable: false,
  type: 'session'
});
```

import js0 from '/src/fragments/lib/analytics/js/autotrack/page-tracking.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ js: js0 }} />

Note: Amplify doesn't capture the location automatically. Instead, you can add the location information in the default config when you [configure Analytics](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/js#set-up-existing-analytics-backend) or while [updating the end point](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/analytics/getting-started/q/platform/js#update-endpoint).
