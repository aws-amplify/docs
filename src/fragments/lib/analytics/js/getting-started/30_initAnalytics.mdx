It's recommended you add the Amplify configuration step to your app's root entry point. For example `App.js` in React or `main.ts` in Angular.

```javascript
import { Amplify, Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';
import awsconfig from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
```

User session data is automatically collected unless you disabled analytics. To see the results visit the [Amazon Pinpoint console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/home/).
