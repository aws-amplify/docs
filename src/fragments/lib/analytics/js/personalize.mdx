Amazon Personalize can create recommendations by using event data, historical data, or a combination of both. The event data can then be used to create recommendations.

To record event data, you need the following:

* [A dataset group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-dataset-group)
* [An event tracker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-get-tracker).

For more information, see [Record Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html).

## Installation and Configuration

After creating the Amazon Personalize dataset group, you need to add the `personalize:PutEvents` permission to your Amplify IAM user roles.

An example IAM policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "personalize:PutEvents",
    "Resource": "*"
  }]
}
```

You need the tracking ID of your event tracker. For more information, see [Get a Tracking ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/recording-events.html#event-get-tracker).

Configure Amazon Personalize:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  ...Amplify.getConfig(),
  Analytics: {
    Personalize: {
      // REQUIRED - The trackingId to track the events
      trackingId: '<TRACKING_ID>',

      // REQUIRED -  Amazon Personalize service region
      region: 'us-east-1',

      // OPTIONAL - The number of events to be deleted from the buffer when flushed.
      flushSize: 10,

      // OPTIONAL - The interval in milliseconds to perform a buffer check and flush if necessary.
      flushInterval: 5000 // 5s
    }
  }
});
```
## Working with the API

You can use the `Identify` event type to track a user identity. This lets you connect a user to their actions and record traits about them. To identify a user, specify a unique identifier for the userId property.
 Consider the following user interactions when choosing when and how often to call record with the  Identify eventType:

* After a user registers.
* After a user logs in.
* When a user updates their information (For example, changing or adding a new address).
* Upon loading any pages that are accessible by a logged-in user (optional).

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: "Identify",
  properties: {
     userId: "<USER_ID>"
  }
});
```
You can send events to Amazon personalize by calling the `record` operation. If you already use `Identify` to track end-user data, you can skip the userId, the SDK will fetch the userId based on current browser session.
For information about the properties field, see [Put Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html).

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: "<EVENT_TYPE>",
  userId: "<USER_ID>", // optional
  properties: {
    itemId: "<ITEM_ID>",
    eventValue: "<EVENT_VALUE>"
  }
});
```
You can track iframe and HTML5 media types by using the MediaAutoTrack event type. MediaAutoTrack tracks all media events of the media DOM element that you bind to. `MediaAutoTracker` will automatically track *Play*, *Pause*, *Ended*, *TimeWatched*, and *Resume* in `eventType`. The duration of the event compared to the total length of the media is stored as a percentage value in `eventValue`.

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

record({
  eventType: "MediaAutoTrack",
  userId: "<USER_ID>", // (optional)
  properties: {
    domElementId: "MEDIA DOM ELEMENT ID",
    itemId: "<ITEM_ID>"
  }
});
```

## Flush events
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically *(You can tune it with the `flushInterval` option)*. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API.

```javascript
import { flushEvents } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/personalize';

flushEvents();
```
