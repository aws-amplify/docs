The Amazon Kinesis Firehose analytics provider allows you to send analytics data to an [Amazon Kinesis Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose) stream for reliably storing data.

## Installation and Configuration

Ensure you have [setup IAM permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html) for `firehose:PutRecordBatch`.

Example IAM policy for Amazon Kinesis Firehose:

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "firehose:PutRecordBatch",
    // replace the template fields
    "Resource": "arn:aws:firehose:<Region>:<AccountId>:deliverystream/<StreamName>"
  }]
}
```

Configure Kinesis Firehose:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
  ...Amplify.getConfig(),
  Analytics: {
    KinesisFirehose: {
      // REQUIRED -  Amazon Kinesis Firehose service region
      region: 'us-east-1',

      // OPTIONAL - The buffer size for events in number of items.
      bufferSize: 1000,

      // OPTIONAL - The number of events to be deleted from the buffer when flushed.
      flushSize: 100,

      // OPTIONAL - The interval in milliseconds to perform a buffer check and flush if necessary.
      flushInterval: 5000, // 5s

      // OPTIONAL - The limit for failed recording retries.
      resendLimit: 5
    }
  }
});
```

## Storing data

You can send a data to a Kinesis Firehose stream with the standard `record` method. Any data is acceptable and `streamName` is required:

```javascript
import { record } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/kinesis-firehose';

record({
  data: {
    // The data blob to put into the record
  },
  streamName: 'myKinesisStream'
});
```

## Flush events
The recorded events are saved in a buffer and sent to the remote server periodically *(You can tune it with the `flushInterval` option)*. If needed, you have the option to manually clear all the events from the buffer by using the 'flushEvents' API.

```javascript
import { flushEvents } from 'aws-amplify/analytics/kinesis-firehose';

flushEvents();
```
