Sending user information allows you to associate a user to their user profile and activities or actions in your app.  The user's actions and attributes can also tracked across devices and platforms by using the same `userId`.  

Some scenarios for identifying a user and their associated app activities are:
* When a user completes app sign up
* When a user completes sign in process
* When a user launches your app
* When a user modifies or updates their user profile
