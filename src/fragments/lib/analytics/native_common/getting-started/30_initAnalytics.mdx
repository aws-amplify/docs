<Callout warning="true">

Make sure you call `Amplify.configure` as early as possible in your applicationâ€™s life-cycle. A missing configuration or `NoCredentials` error is thrown if `Amplify.configure` has not been called before other Amplify JavaScript APIs. Review the [Library Not Configured Troubleshooting guide](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/library-not-configured/) for possible causes of this issue.
