For advanced use cases where Amplify does not provide the functionality, you can retrieve the escape hatch to access the underlying Amazon Pinpoint client.

<Callout warning>

**Note:** While the Amplify Library for Swift is production ready, please note that the underlying AWS SDK for Swift is currently in Developer Preview, and is not yet intended for production workloads. [Here is additional reading material](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift/blob/main/docs/stability.md) on the stability of the SDK

</Callout>

Add the following import:

```swift
import AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin
```

Then retrieve the escape hatch with this code:

```swift
do {
    // Retrieve the reference to AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin
    let plugin = try Amplify.Analytics.getPlugin(for: "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin")
    guard let analyticsPlugin = plugin as? AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin else {
        return
    }
    
    // Retrieve the reference to PinpointClientProtocol
    let pinpointClient = analyticsPlugin.getEscapeHatch()

    // Make requests using pinpointClient...
    // ...
} catch {
    print("Get escape hatch failed with error - \(error)")
}
```
