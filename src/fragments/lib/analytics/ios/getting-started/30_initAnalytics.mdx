To use the Amplify Analytics and Authentication categories in your app, you need to create and configure their corresponding plugins by calling the `Amplify.add(plugin:)` and `Amplify.configure()` methods.

<Block name="SwiftUI">

Add the following imports to the top of your main `App` file:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin
```

Add the following code to its initializer. If there is none, you can create a default `init`:

```swift
init() {
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with Auth and Analytics plugins")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="UIKit">

Add the following imports to the top of your `AppDelegate.swift` file:

```swift
import Amplify
import AWSCognitoAuthPlugin
import AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin
```

Add the following code to the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift
func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
) -> Bool {
    do {
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSCognitoAuthPlugin())
        try Amplify.add(plugin: AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin())
        try Amplify.configure()
        print("Amplify configured with Auth and Analytics plugins")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to initialize Amplify with \(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

</Block>

Upon building and running this application you should see the following in your console window:

```console
Amplify configured with Auth and Analytics plugin
```
