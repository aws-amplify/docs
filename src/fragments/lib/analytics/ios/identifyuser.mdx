This call sends information about the current user (which could be unauthenticated or authenticated) to Amazon Pinpoint.

You can provide `name`, `email` and `plan`, as well as location information with `AnalyticsUserProfile.Location`. You can also send additional custom attributes using  `AnalyticsProperties`.

If the user is signed in through [Amplify.Auth.signIn](/lib/auth/signin), then you can retrieve the current user's ID as shown below: 

```swift
guard let user = Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser() else {
    print("Could not get user, perhaps the user is not signed in")
    return
}

let location = AnalyticsUserProfile.Location(latitude: 47.606209,
                                             longitude: -122.332069,
                                             postalCode: "98122",
                                             city: "Seattle",
                                             region: "WA",
                                             country: "USA")
                                             
let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
    "phoneNumber": "+11234567890",
    "age": 25
]

let userProfile = AnalyticsUserProfile(name: "username",
                                       email: "name@example.com",
                                       plan: "plan"
                                       location: location,
                                       properties: properties)

Amplify.Analytics.identifyUser(user.userId, withProfile: userProfile)
```
