This call sends information about the current user (which could be unauthenticated or authenticated) to Amazon Pinpoint.

You can provide `name`, `email` and `plan`, as well as location information with `AnalyticsUserProfile.Location`. You can also send additional custom attributes using `AnalyticsProperties`.

If the user is signed in through [Amplify.Auth.signIn](/[platform]/build-a-backend/auth/enable-sign-in/), then you can retrieve the current user's ID as shown below:

```swift

let user = try await Amplify.Auth.getCurrentUser()

let location = AnalyticsUserProfile.Location(
    latitude: 47.606209,
    longitude: -122.332069,
    postalCode: "98122",
    city: "Seattle",
    region: "WA",
    country: "USA"
)

let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
    "phoneNumber": "+11234567890",
    "age": 25
]

let userProfile = AnalyticsUserProfile(
    name: "username",
    email: "name@example.com",
    plan: "plan",
    location: location,
    properties: properties
)

Amplify.Analytics.identifyUser(
    userId: user.userId,
    userProfile: userProfile
)
```
