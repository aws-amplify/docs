## Record Event

The Amplify Analytics plugin provides a simple interface to record custom events within your app:

```swift
let properties: AnalyticsProperties = [
    "eventPropertyStringKey": "eventPropertyStringValue",
    "eventPropertyIntKey": 123,
    "eventPropertyDoubleKey": 12.34,
    "eventPropertyBoolKey": true
]
let event = BasicAnalyticsEvent(name: "eventName", properties: properties)

Amplify.Analytics.record(event: event)
```

## Flush Events

By default, events are automatically flushed out to the network every 60 seconds. 

If you would like to change this, update `amplifyconfiguration.json` and set the value you would prefer under `autoFlushEventsInterval`, expressed in seconds:

```json
{
    "UserAgent": "aws-amplify-cli/2.0",
    "Version": "1.0",
    "analytics": {
        "plugins": {
            "awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin": {
                "pinpointAnalytics": {
                    "appId": "AppID",
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "pinpointTargeting": {
                    "region": "Region"
                },
                "autoFlushEventsInterval": 60
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note**
>
> Setting `autoFlushEventsInterval` to 0 will disable the automatic flush of events and you will be responsible for submitting them.


To manually submit the recoded events to the backend, call:

```swift
Amplify.Analytics.flushEvents()
```

The plugin automatically batches requests in order to reduce network bandwidth and handles the retry logic if the device loses connectivity.

## Global Properties

You can register properties which will be included across all `Amplify.Analytics.record(event:)` calls.

```swift
let globalProperties: AnalyticsProperties = [
    "globalPropertyKey": "value"
]
Amplify.Analytics.registerGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

To unregister global properties, call `Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()`:

```swift
// When called with no arguments, it unregisters all global properties
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties()

// Or you can specify which properties to unregister
let globalProperties = ["globalPropertyKey1", "globalPropertyKey2"]
Amplify.Analytics.unregisterGlobalProperties(globalProperties)
```

## Disable Analytics

To disable the analytics data collection, call:

```swift
Amplify.Analytics.disable()
```

## Enable Analytics

To re-enable the analytics data collection, call:

```swift
Amplify.Analytics.enable()
```
