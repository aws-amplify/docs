Amplify uses SQLite via the drift package. This requires a custom build of SQLite when targeting web. You will need to download a sqlite3.wasm file from the releases of the sqlite3 pub package and put this file in your web/ folder. For more info, see [https://drift.simonbinder.eu/web/#drift-wasm](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/web/#drift-wasm).
