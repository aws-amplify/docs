In your application directory, you should first install the necessary dependencies for using In-App Messaging.

```bash
npm install aws-amplify
```

### Initialize In-App Messaging

To finish setting up your application with Amplify, you need to configure it using the `configure` API. Next, to interact with In-App Messaging APIs, you need to first initialize In-App Messaging by calling the `initializeInAppMessaging` API directly imported from the `in-app-messaging` sub-path. This is required to be called as early as possible in the app lifecycle.

```js
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';
import { initializeInAppMessaging } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';

Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);
initializeInAppMessaging();
```

import reactnative0 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/react-native/install-dependencies.mdx';

import js0 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/js/install-ui-dependencies.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'react-native': reactnative0, js: js0 }} />

### Integrate Amplify UI

Amplify UI provides a Higher-Order Component for ease of integrating the In-App Messaging UI with your application. Simply wrap your application root component in, for example, `App.js`.

import reactnative2 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/react-native/hoc-setup.mdx';

import js2 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/js/hoc-setup.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'react-native': reactnative2, js: js2 }} />

Below is an example of what your entry file should look like:

import reactnative3 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/react-native/full-example.mdx';

import js3 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/js/full-example.mdx';

<Fragments fragments={{ 'react-native': reactnative3, js: js3 }} />

<!-- TODO What would happen for frameworks other than React? Would they NOT see this popup? what should we do for them? -->

You can now build and run your app in your terminal. If you click on one of the buttons shown in the above example, the in-app message you defined in the Pinpoint console should be displayed in your app.
