### Install Amplify and its dependencies

```bash
npm install aws-amplify @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill
```

The AWS SDK requires React Native applications to polyfill `crypto.getRandomValues` and `URL`. Import it at the top of your application's root entry point (in most React Native apps this will be the top level `index.js`).

```js
// Example index.js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';

import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
import { name as appName } from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### Install Amplify UI for React Native and its dependencies

import reactnative0 from '/src/fragments/lib/in-app-messaging/integrate-your-application/ui-integration.mdx';
