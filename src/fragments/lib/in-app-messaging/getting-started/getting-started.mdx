## Prerequisites

Make sure you have completed the below steps:

- [Completed the CLI and project setup steps.](/[platform]/start/project-setup/prerequisites/)

## Create backend resources

After completing prerequisite steps above, proceed with creating backend resources for use with In-App Messaging via the CLI.

```bash
amplify add notifications

? Choose the notification channel to enable …  (Use arrow keys or type to filter)
  APNS |  Apple Push Notifications
  FCM  | » Firebase Push Notifications
❯ In-App Messaging
  Email
  SMS

? Provide your pinpoint resource name: (inappmessaging)

? Apps need authorization to send analytics events.
Do you want to allow guests and unauthenticated
users to send analytics events?
(we recommend you allow this when getting started) (Y/n)

✔ The In-App Messaging channel has been successfully enabled.
```

Now that your In-App Messaging channel is enabled, you can now push the changes to the cloud.

```bash
amplify push
```
