Your code can respond with additional behavior to your users interacting with in-app messages by adding interaction event listeners.

## Message received

Add `onMessageReceived` listeners to respond to an in-app message being received from the library as the result of an event matching the criteria of a synced in-app message. This is required if you are implementing a custom UI.

```js
const myMessageReceivedHandler = (message) => {
  // Do something with the received message
};

const listener = InAppMessaging.onMessageReceived(myMessageReceivedHandler);

listener.remove(); // Remember to remove the listener when it is no longer needed
```

## Message displayed

Add `onMessageDisplayed` listeners to respond to an in-app message being displayed to your user.

```js
const myMessageDisplayedHandler = (message) => {
  // Do something with the displayed message
};

const listener = InAppMessaging.onMessageDisplayed(myMessageDisplayedHandler);

listener.remove(); // Remember to remove the listener when it is no longer needed
```

## Message dismissed

Add `onMessageDismissed` listeners to respond to an in-app message being dismissed by your user.

```js
const myMessageDismissedHandler = (message) => {
  // Do something with the dismissed message
};

const listener = InAppMessaging.onMessageDismissed(myMessageDismissedHandler);

listener.remove(); // Remember to remove the listener when it is no longer needed
```

## Message action taken

Add `onMessageActionTaken` listeners to respond to an action being taken on an in-app message. Typically, this means that the user has tapped or clicked a button on an in-app message.

```js
const myMessageActionTakenHandler = (message) => {
  // Do something with the message action was taken against
};

const listener = InAppMessaging.onMessageActionTaken(
  myMessageActionTakenHandler
);

listener.remove(); // Remember to remove the listener when it is no longer needed
```

## Notifying listeners

If you are using the Amplify In-App Messaging UI, interaction events notifications are already wired up for you. However, if you are implementing your own UI, you will need to notify listeners of interaction events through your UI code.

```js
/**
 * Interaction events that can be notified correspond to their respective listeners:
 *   'MESSAGE_RECEIVED_EVENT'
 *   'MESSAGE_DISPLAYED_EVENT'
 *   'MESSAGE_DISMISSED_EVENT'
 *   'MESSAGE_ACTION_TAKEN_EVENT'
 */
InAppMessaging.notifyMessageInteraction('MESSAGE_DISPLAYED_EVENT');
```

  If you are using TypeScript for your development, you can also import and use
  the InAppMessageInteractionEvent enum.
