To trigger messages, you must sync them from your In-App Messaging campaigns to your users' devices. These messages are then triggered with an analytics or In-App Messaging event. You can control when and how often this sync is performed.

```js
import { syncMessages } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';

await syncMessages();
```

<Callout informational>
  NOTE: Syncing messages will always overwrite existing messages currently on
  the user's device so they are always up to date when the sync is performed.
