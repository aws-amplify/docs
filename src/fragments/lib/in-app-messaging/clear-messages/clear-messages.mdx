Once messages have been synced to your userâ€™s device, `clearMessages()` can be used to clear the synced messages.

```js
import { clearMessages } from 'aws-amplify/in-app-messaging';

await clearMessages();
```

<Callout informational>
  NOTE: If your app has authentication implemented, we recommend calling
  clearMessages() in between user log-ins to remove messages targeted for
  specific user segments. This is especially important if you anticipate your
  application will be used in shared device scenarios.
