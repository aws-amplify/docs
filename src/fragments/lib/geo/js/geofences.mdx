## Provisioning geofence resources

## Manage Geofences in Your Application

First, make sure you've provisioned a geofence collection resource and configured your app using the instructions in either [Amplify CLI - Geo - Geofence Collection](/cli/geo/geofences) or [Use existing Amazon Location Service resources](/lib/geo/existing-resources) and you have already setup [displaying a map](/lib/geo/maps) in your application.

To add a geofence management component to your map, you can use the [amplify-geofence-control](https://github.com/aws-amplify/maplibre-gl-js-amplify/) found in the `https://github.com/aws-amplify/maplibre-gl-js-amplify/` library.

Install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install -S maplibre-gl@1 maplibre-gl-js-amplify
```

> **Note:** Make sure that `maplibre-gl-js-amplify` version `1.2.0` or above is installed.

First, create a map onto which you want to add the geofence management component. See the guide on [creating and displaying maps](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/geo/maps/q/platform/js/).

Then, import `AmplifyGeofenceControl` from "maplibre-gl-js-amplify", create a new instance of this control and add it to your MapLibre map instance.

Your app should look like the following

> **Note:** Ensure that your package bundler (webpack, rollup, etc) is configured to handle css files. Check out the webpack documentation [here](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/).

```javascript
import { createMap, AmplifyGeofenceControl } from "maplibre-gl-js-amplify";
import maplibregl from "maplibre-gl";
import "maplibre-gl/dist/maplibre-gl.css";

async function initializeMap() {
    const el = document.createElement("div");
    el.setAttribute("id", "map");
    document.body.appendChild(el);

    const map = await createMap({
        container: "map",
        center: [-123.1187, 49.2819], // [Longitude, Latitude]
        zoom: 11,
    })

    const control = new AmplifyGeofenceControl({})
    map.addControl(control);
}

initializeMap();
```
