Amplify Geo provides solutions for common use cases with [Amazon Location Service](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) but for any functionality that is not currently supported by Amplify Geo you can access the [Amazon Location Service SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/tree/main/clients/client-location) directly.

Follow this guide to get started with the `aws-sdk` for Amazon Location Service using Amplify Auth credentials.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we’ll go over the following:

- Setting up the AWS SDK JavaScript v3 package for the Amazon Location Service SDK calls with Amplify auth.
- Code examples using the Amazon Location Service SDK.

## Installing SDK dependencies

The first step to using the SDKs in the client is to install the necessary dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-location
```

## Connecting your app to Amazon Location Service

In the following procedure, you’ll connect your app to the Amazon Location Service APIs.

**To connect your app to the Amazon Location Service**

In your React App, open `src/App.js` file, and call the following function to initialize the Amazon Location Service client:

```javascript
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import { fetchAuthSession } from 'aws-amplify/auth';
import {
  LocationClient,
  AssociateTrackerConsumerCommand
} from '@aws-sdk/client-location';
import amplifyconfig from './amplifyconfiguration.json';
Amplify.configure(amplifyconfig);

const createClient = async () => {
  const session = await fetchAuthSession();
  const client = new LocationClient({
    credentials: session.credentials,
    region: amplifyconfig.aws_project_region
  });
  return client;
};
```

You’ve now successfully connected your app to the Amazon Location Service.

## Using the Amazon Location Service APIs

In order to access Amazon Location Service APIs, ensure you've provisioned resources and configured your app using the instructions in either [Amplify CLI Geo Maps docs](/cli/geo/maps) or the [Amazon Location Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/location/home#/create).

You can check out the [Amazon Location API Reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/location/index.html) for a complete list of supported features.

### Example: Getting Device Position

This example requires you to have first provisioned a Tracker resource using the [Amazon Location Service console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/location/tracking/home#/create).

The following code details how to use the Amazon Location Service APIs to update a device position and get a device position using the tracker you just created:

```javascript
// UpdateDevicePosition API
const params = {
  TrackerName: 'trackerId',
  Updates: [
    {
      DeviceId: 'deviceId',
      Position: [-122.431297, 37.773972],
      SampleTime: new Date()
    }
  ]
};
const command = new BatchUpdateDevicePositionCommand(params);
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  if (data) console.log(data);
});

// GetDevicePosition API
const client = await createClient();
const params = {
  TrackerName: 'trackerId',
  DeviceId: 'deviceId'
};
const command = new GetDevicePositionCommand(params);
client.send(command, (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.error(err);
  if (data) console.log(data);
});
```
