### Search for text

The `Amplify.Geo.search(for text:)` API enables you to search for places or points of interest by free-form text, such as an address, name, city, or region.

```swift
do {
    let places = try await Amplify.Geo.search(for: "coffee shops")
    dump(places)
} catch {
    print(error)
}
```

You can refine your search by specifying following parameters inside `Geo.SearchForTextOptions`

- `area`
  - `.near` - to act as the search origination location.
  - `.within` - to limit the area to search within.
- `countries` - to limit the search results to given countries.
- `maxResults` - to limit the maximum result set (defaults to 50).

```swift
let coordinates = Geo.Coordinates(latitude: 47.62246, longitude: -122.336775)
let options = Geo.SearchForTextOptions(area: .near(coordinates), countries: [.usa, .can], maxResults: 25)

do {
    let places = try await Amplify.Geo.search(for: "coffee shops", options: options)
    dump(places)
} catch let error as Geo.Error {
    print("Failed to search: \(error)"
} catch {
    print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```
