### Select your user interface

There are two ways to display a map. The easiest way to get started is to use the `AmplifyMaplibreUI` library to create an instance of `AMLMapView`. This is the recommended approach for new projects or anyone who wants to use SwiftUI.

Alternatively, if you are using UIKit or have existing code using the MapLibre/MapBox SDK, you can simpley call `AmplifyMapLibre.createMap()` to create an instance of `MGLMapView` that is pre-wired for use with Amazon Location Service and Amplify.

<Block name="SwiftUI">

```swift
import SwiftUI
import AmplifyMapLibreUI
import AmplifyMapLibreAdapter
import Mapbox
import Amplify

struct ContentView: View {    
    var body: some View {
        AMLMapView()
            .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
    }
}
```

</Block>

<Block name="UIKit">

```swift
import AmplifyMapLibreAdapter
import Mapbox
import Amplify

var mapView: MGLMapView?

AmplifyMapLibre.createMap { result in
    switch result {
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    case .success(let map):
        mapView = map
    }
}
```

</Block>

## Customize the map and access state

The `AMLMapView` can be customized through a number of view modifiers, and map state information can be set and access through an instance of `AMLMapViewState`, which can optionally be passed into `AMLMapView` to set initial values. The following example sets an inital zoom level and center location for the map and configures the map to show the user's location.

```swift
@StateObject private var mapState = AMLMapViewState(
    zoomLevel: 8,
    center: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 39.7392, longitude: -104.9903))

var body: some View {
    AMLMapView(mapState: mapState)
        .showUserLocation(true)
        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
}
```
