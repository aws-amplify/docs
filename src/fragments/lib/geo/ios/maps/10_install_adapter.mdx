MapLibre is
[not officially supported on macOS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/blob/9d37d3d4aab293675f3df3a7f9bee7b2f476daf5/platform/ios/platform/macos/README.md?plain=1#L22),
and as a result `amplify-ios-maplibre` can only be used on iOS. Apple's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/)
framework may be used in order to display maps on macOS applications.

1. Enter the amplify-ios-maplibre GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios-maplibre`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**. Wait for the result to load. You'll see the repository rules for which version of amplify-ios-mapLibre you want Swift Package Manager to install. 

1. Choose the dependency rule **Up to Next Major Version**, as it will use the latest compatible version of the dependency, then click **Add Package**.

1. Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. If you want to use the SwiftUI user interface components provided by the adapter, select both **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter** and **AmplifyMapLibreUI**. If you only want to enable Amplify Geo to work directly with MapLibre and do not wish use use the provided SwiftUI views, you can just select **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter**. After you select the libraries, click **Add Package**.
