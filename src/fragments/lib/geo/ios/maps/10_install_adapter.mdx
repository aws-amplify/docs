MapLibre is
[not officially supported on macOS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/blob/9d37d3d4aab293675f3df3a7f9bee7b2f476daf5/platform/ios/platform/macos/README.md?plain=1#L22),
and as a result `amplify-ios-maplibre` can only be used on iOS. Apple's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/)
framework may be used in order to display maps on macOS applications.

First, ensure you've provisioned an Amazon Location Service Map resource and configured your app using the instructions in either [Configure maps](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/configure-maps/) or [Use existing resources](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/existing-resources/) guide.

Amplify-MapLibre is an open source adapter that enables the popular MapLibre SDK to work seamlessly with Amplify Geo.

1. To install the Amplify-MapLibre adapter to your application, open your project in Xcode and select **File > Add Packages...**

1. Enter the amplify-ios-maplibre GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios-maplibre`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**. Wait for the result to load. You'll see the repository rules for which version of amplify-ios-mapLibre you want Swift Package Manager to install. 

1. Choose the dependency rule **Up to Next Major Version**, as it will use the latest compatible version of the dependency, then click **Add Package**.

1. Lastly, choose which of the libraries you want added to your project. If you want to use the SwiftUI user interface components provided by the adapter, select both **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter** and **AmplifyMapLibreUI**. If you only want to enable Amplify Geo to work directly with MapLibre and do not wish use use the provided SwiftUI views, you can just select **AmplifyMapLibreAdapter**. After you select the libraries, click **Add Package**.
