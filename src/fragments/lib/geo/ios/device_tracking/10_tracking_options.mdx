* **`tracker`**: Name of the tracker resource in Amazon Location Service to send location updates.  If you don't provide a tracker name, then the default tracker is used.
* **`desiredAccuracy`**: A value to request the desired level of accuracy of location updates in meters.  The requested desired accuracy is not guaranteed to be achieved.
* **`requestAlwaysAuthorization`**: If true, Amplify will request Always Authorization permission to always receive location updates from the OS.
* **`allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates`**: If true, location updates will be received from the OS when the app is in the background.
* **`pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically`**: If true, allow the OS to pause location updates to optimize battery usages.
* **`activityType`**: If `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically` is true, the OS will decide appropriate times to pause location updates to improve battery life based on the `activityTYpe`.
* **`showsBackgroundLocationIndicator`**: If this is true and `requestAlwaysAuthorization` is true, the background location indicator is displayed and visible to the users.  This option is not supported on MacOS.
* **`disregardLocationUpdatesWhenOffline`**: If true, the app will not store location updates when the app is offline. This is false by default; Amplify will store location updates locally due to loss of network connectivity and send location updates when app is online.
* **`wakeAppForSignificantLocationChanges`**: If true, the app will be woken up by significant location updates after an app has been force closed. In order to take advantage of this, you'll need to call `Amplify.Geo.startTracking()` in your apps launch lifecycle method. (e.g. `didFinishedLoading`)
* **`distanceFilter`**: If set, the minimum distance in meters at which the OS will update the app with a new location.
* **`trackUntil`**: If a date is set, the app will stop tracking when date is reached. By default, tracking will continue until `stopTracking()` is called.
* **`batchingOptions`**: Custom defined behavior to send location updates in batches based on a specified threshold.
