**Parameter Name**                        | **Default Value**           | **Description** 
----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**`tracker`**                             |  `nil`                      | Name of the tracker resource in Amazon Location Service to send location updates.  If you don't provide a tracker name, then the default tracker in Amplify configuration is used.
**`desiredAccuracy`**                     | `.fine`                     | A value to request the desired level of accuracy of location updates.  The requested desired accuracy is not guaranteed to be achieved.
**`requestAlwaysAuthorization`**          | `true`                      | If true, Amplify will request Always Authorization permission to always receive location updates from the OS.
**`allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates`**     | `false`                     | If true, location updates will be received from the OS when the app is in the background.
**`pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically`**  | `true`                      | If true, allow the OS to pause location updates to optimize battery usages.
**`activityType`**                        | `.automotive-` `Navigation`               | If `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically` is true, the OS will decide appropriate times to pause location updates to improve battery life based on the `activityType`.
**`showsBackgroundLocationIndicator`**    | `false`                     | If true and `requestAlwaysAuthorization` is true, the background location indicator is displayed and visible to the users.  This option is not supported on MacOS.
**`disregardLocationUpdatesWhenOffline`** | `false`                     | If true, the app will not store location updates when the app is offline. This is false by default; Amplify will store location updates locally due to loss of network connectivity and send location updates when app is online.
**`wakeAppForSignificantLocationChanges`** | `false`                    | If true, the app will be woken up by significant location updates after an app has been force closed. In order to take advantage of this, you'll need to call `Amplify.Geo.startTracking()` in your apps launch lifecycle method. (e.g. `didFinishedLoading`)
**`distanceFilter`**                      | `0`                         | If set, the minimum distance in meters at which the OS will update the app with a new location.
**`trackUntil`**                          | `.distantFuture`            | If set, the app will stop tracking when date is reached. By default, tracking will continue until user logOut or `stopTracking()` is called.
**`batchingOptions`**                     | `.none`                     | Custom defined behavior to send location updates in batches based on a specified threshold.
