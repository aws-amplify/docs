If you need functionality in the AWSLocation framework used by the Amplify Geo category that isn't available, we provide an escape hatch so you can reference it directly.

Note: If you provisioned your Geo resources via Amplify CLI, then the IAM policy will be specifically scoped to only allow actions required by the library. Please [adjust your authorization permissions](/gen1/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/existing-resources/) accordingly for your escape hatch use-cases.

```swift
import AWSLocation
```

Then retrieve the escape hatch and call methods on `AWSLocation` directly:

```swift
do {
    // Retrieve AWSLocationGeoPlugin
    let plugin = try Amplify.Geo.getPlugin(for: "awsLocationGeoPlugin")
    guard let locationPlugin = plugin as? AWSLocationGeoPlugin else {
        return
    }

    // Retrieve reference to AWSLocation
    let awsLocation = locationPlugin.getEscapeHatch()

    // Make Request
    var request = ListMapsInput()
    request.maxResults = 5
    let response = try await awsLocation.listMaps(input: request)
    // handle response ...
} catch {
    print("Error occurred while fetching the escape hatch \(error)")
}
```
