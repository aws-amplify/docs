If you need functionality in the AWSLocation framework used by the Amplify Geo category that isn't available, we provide an escape hatch so you can reference it directly.

<Callout warning>

**Note:** While the Amplify Library for Swift is production ready, please note that the underlying AWS SDK for Swift is currently in Developer Preview, and is not yet intended for production workloads. [Here is additional reading material](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift/blob/main/docs/stability.md) on the stability of the SDK

</Callout>

Note: If you provisioned your Geo resources via Amplify CLI, then the IAM policy will be specifically scoped to only allow actions required by the library.
Please [adjust your authorization permissions](/lib/geo/existing-resources) accordingly for your escape hatch use-cases.

```swift
import AWSLocation
```

Then retrieve the escape hatch and call methods on `AWSLocation` directly:

```swift
do {
    // Retrieve AWSLocationGeoPlugin
    let plugin = try Amplify.Geo.getPlugin(for: "awsLocationGeoPlugin")
    guard let locationPlugin = plugin as? AWSLocationGeoPlugin else {
        return
    }

    // Retrieve reference to AWSLocation
    let awsLocation = locationPlugin.getEscapeHatch()

    // Make Request
    var request = ListMapsInput()
    request.maxResults = 5
    let response = try await awsLocation.listMaps(input: request)
    // handle response ...
} catch {
    print("Error occurred while fetching the escape hatch \(error)")
}
```
