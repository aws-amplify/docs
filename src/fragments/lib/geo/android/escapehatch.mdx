If you need functionality in the AWS services used by the Amplify Geo category that isn't available, we provide an escape hatch so you can get a reference to that service.

Note: If you provisioned your Geo resources via Amplify CLI, then the IAM policy will be specifically scoped to only allow actions required by the library.
Please [adjust your authorization permissions](/lib/geo/existing-resources) accordingly for your escape hatch use-cases.
