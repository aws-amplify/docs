> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

The primary way to provision Geo resources is through the Amplify CLI. Currently, Amplify Geo is in developer preview and you need to install the CLI with the `@geo` tag. You can use the following command to install this version globally.

```sh
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

Now, let's make sure that the right version was installed:

```sh
amplify --version
```

That should show a version with the `-geo.x` tag, for example, `6.0.1-geo.0`.

> **Note:** Make sure that version `6.0.1-geo.0` or above is installed.

Once that is complete, you can run the following command from your project's root folder to initialize Amplify in your repo:

```sh
amplify init
```

Now you are able to add a `geo` resource, such as map resources or a search index:

```sh
amplify add geo
```

The CLI will prompt configuration options for the Geo category for what type of capability you want to add and default or advanced settings.

Amplify Android will be proceeding with developer preview for Geo in incremental releases. The current version of Amplify Android does not support the search APIs.

The `add` command automatically creates the backend configuration. Once all your configuration is complete run the following:

```sh
amplify push
```

A file named `amplifyconfiguration.json` that contains all geo-related configuration information will be created in your app's `src/main/res/raw` directory.
