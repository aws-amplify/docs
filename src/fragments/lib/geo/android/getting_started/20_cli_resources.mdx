> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/cli/start/install)

The primary way to provision Geo resources is through the Amplify CLI. You can use the following command to install this globally.

```sh
npm i -g @aws-amplify/cli@geo
```

Now, let's make sure that the right version was installed:

```sh
amplify --version
```

That should show a version with the `-geo.x` tag, for example, `6.0.1-geo.0`.

> **Note:** Make sure that version `6.0.1-geo.0` or above is installed.

Once that is complete, you can run the following command from your project's root folder to initialize Amplify in your repo:

```sh
amplify init
```

The above command will guide you through setting up your project name and preferred authentication profile.

Now you are able to add a `geo` resource, such as map resources or a search index:

```sh
amplify add geo
```

The CLI will let you configure the Geo category based on the capabilities you want to add (maps and/or search). You can either choose to stick with the defaults or configure advanced settings. Please refer to [Amplify CLI Geo docs](/cli/geo/maps/) for more details on these configurations.

The add command automatically creates the backend configuration. Once all your configuration is complete, run the following (this might take a few minutes):

```sh
amplify push
```

A file named `amplifyconfiguration.json` that contains all geo-related configuration information will be created in your app's `src/main/res/raw` directory.
