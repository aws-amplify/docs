> Prerequisite: [Install and configure the Amplify CLI](/[platform]/tools/cli/start/set-up-cli/)

To start provisioning Geo resources in the backend, go to your project directory and execute the command:

```sh
amplify init
```

The above command will guide you through setting up your project name and preferred authentication profile.
Refer to ["Create your application"](/[platform]/start/project-setup/create-application/) section for detailed project setup guide.

Now you are able to add a `geo` resource, such as map resources or a search index:

```sh
amplify add geo
```

The CLI will let you configure the Geo category based on the capabilities you want to add (maps and/or search).
You can either choose to stick with the defaults or configure advanced settings.
Please refer to [Amplify CLI Geo docs](/[platform]/build-a-backend/more-features/geo/configure-maps/) for more details on these configurations.

The `add` command automatically creates the backend configuration. Once all your configuration is complete, run the following (this might take a few minutes):

```sh
amplify push
```

A file named `amplifyconfiguration.json` that contains all geo-related configuration information will be created in your app's `src/main/res/raw` directory.
