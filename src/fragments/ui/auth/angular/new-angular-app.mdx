Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to bootstrap a new Angular app:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new myAmplifyProject
cd myAmplifyProject
```

### Angular 6+ Support

Currently, the newest versions of Angular (6+) do not include shims for 'global' or 'process' which were provided in previous versions. Add the following to your `polyfills.ts` file to recreate them: 

```javascript
(window as any).global = window;
(window as any).process = {
  env: { DEBUG: undefined },
};
```
