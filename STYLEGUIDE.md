# Amplify Docs Styleguides

These are the guidelines we use to write our docs. When reviewing writings, for instance in PRs, refer to the rules by their number for easy reference.

## 1. ‚ÄúAmplify [product]‚Äù not ‚ÄúAmplify Framework‚Äù

When writing, refer specifically to the Amplify product in question: UI, CLI, Libraries, Studio, or Hosting. In the past, when Amplify was a handful of JavaScript libraries and a CLI, ‚ÄúAmplify Framework‚Äù was a useful umbrella term. But now it is confusing.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúAmplify Framework has an authentication UI component that provides an entire authentication flow.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúAmplify UI has an authentication UI component that provides an entire authentication flow.‚Äù
* * *

## 2. ‚ÄúAmplify project‚Äù not ‚ÄúAmplify app‚Äù

We call them ‚ÄúAmplify projects‚Äù to underscore that Amplify features can be used in any project, any app. We don‚Äôt use ‚ÄúAmplify app‚Äù because it sounds like Amplify is a platform (‚ÄúiOS app‚Äù or ‚Äúweb app‚Äù).

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúGet started with a new Amplify app!‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúGet started with a new Amplify project!‚Äù
* * *

## 3. Do not assume proficiency

Avoid using language that assumes someone‚Äôs level of proficiency. Something that is difficult for someone new to programming may not be for a senior engineer. This language can inadvertently alienate or insult a reader. Avoid words like ‚Äújust,‚Äù ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù ‚Äúsenior,‚Äù ‚Äúhard.‚Äù

### Don‚Äôt

* ‚ÄúJust implement a cache, and your images will be served nearby your user.‚Äù Use of ‚Äújust‚Äù implies reader knows how to do this.
* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to import Amplify UI components to your app.‚Äù ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù implies either the reader finds this difficult with other components, or, if the reader is still learning how to import components, it can undermine their confidence.

### Do

* ‚ÄúYou can implement a cache to serve images from nearby your user.‚Äù Indicates it is possible. Bonus: link to guide on implementing a cache!
* ‚ÄúYou can import Amplify UI components into your app with 2 lines of code.‚Äù Use objective numbers and facts to explain the level of complexity readers can expect, not adjectives.

* * *

## 4. Be culturally neutral; avoid colloquialisms and pop culture references

Different cultures have different idioms, different ‚Äúin-jokes,‚Äù and different pop cultures. Using idioms, turns of phrase, and references to ‚Äúcommon‚Äù stories and franchises in our documentation to sound more approachable can have the opposite effect, alienating people from different cultures who do not get the references by assuming universality of a dominant culture. What‚Äôs more, colorful phrases can make it harder to auto-translate documentation as well. So we use references that can be universally understood across cultures when distilled to factual statements

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúSomething that is difficult for someone new to programming may be child‚Äôs play for a senior engineer.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery Han Solo has his Chewbacca: find a study buddy to team up with.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúSomething that is difficult for someone new to programming may not be for a senior engineer.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúStudying in pairs can help you see problems in a new light, so find a study buddy to team up with.‚Äù
* * *

## 5. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù are the authors; ‚Äúyou‚Äù is the reader

When writing, use ‚Äúyou‚Äù to refer to the reader, use ‚Äúwe‚Äù to refer to the team writing docs and building Amplify. Using ‚Äúwe‚Äù is popular in technical blogs and YouTube content where the author is individually taking the person on the other side of the screen on a journey. They may say things like, ‚ÄúTo access the console, we just use `amplify console`.‚Äù This is confusing in official docs because they are written by many people and represent the team that builds Amplify. ‚ÄúWe‚Äù should be used very rarely in documentation‚Äîonly when explaining technical decisions or official recommendations where you could substitute ‚ÄúAmplify Team.‚Äù

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúCongratulations, our app is online!‚Äù

‚ÄúAmplify recommends you use X because it‚Äôs been built to run with Feature Y.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúCongratulations, your app is online!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe recommend you use X because it‚Äôs been built to run with Feature Y.‚Äù
* * *

## 6. Use American English

English comes in many flavors. This site uses American English as most of its core contributors and maintainers use American English.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúYou may realise your programme is running faster now.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúYou may realize your program is running faster now.‚Äù
* * *

## 7. Use task and outcome-based headings and titles that use verbs

Where possible, use action verbs or gerunds (nouns ending -ing‚Äîlike ‚Äúkayaking‚Äù) in headings and titles that describe a task or outcome. Avoid nouns and phrases that begin with prepositions and vague words like ‚Äúabout,‚Äù ‚Äúadvanced,‚Äù ‚Äúintro.‚Äù 

**Guideline:** If you can‚Äôt think of an action-oriented title, there‚Äôs a chance this content will end up in the information architecture equivalent of a ‚Äújunk drawer‚Äù where many disparate pieces of edge case content are thrown together an not found by the people who need it. **If you‚Äôre stuck, solicit ideas!**

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúIntro to Amplify‚Äù

‚ÄúData modeling‚Äù (this is a sneaky noun!)

‚ÄúAdvanced Analytics‚Äù

‚ÄúData intro‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúGet started with Amplify‚Äù

‚ÄúModeling your data / Model your data‚Äù

‚ÄúSetting up Analytics for single page apps‚Äù

‚ÄúHow to model your data'‚Äù
* * *

## 8. Hyphens? Spaces? Neither!

New words tend to be hyphenated or spaced while still new. Programmers tend to save a keystroke by writing them together, and search engines trends reflect this with concatenated words being searched for more. When in doubt: concatenate. It may not be ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù to the Oxford English Dictionary, but it is the convention the community uses. We follow community convention.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúFront end and full-stack developers often JavaScript.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúFrontend and fullstack developers use JavaScript.‚Äù
* * *

## 9. Emojis are for personal blogs, Twitter, ‚Äúflavor‚Äù content

Do not use emojis. They are too casual for official docs and may not translate universally to all audiences.

### Don‚Äôt

‚Äúüëè Congratulations, your app is online!‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúCongratulations, your app is online!‚Äù
* * *

## 10. Avoid pronouns

Pronouns are difficult to translate into some languages. They also tend to be gendered, which provides unnecessary bias.


### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúWhen he opens the app, he will see a loading screen.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúWhen the user opens the app, it will show a loading screen.‚Äù
* * *

## 11. Avoid gerunds (-ing words)

"To" forms of verbs are easier to translate.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúSetting up Amplify UI only takes two lines of code.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúYou can set up Amplify UI with two lines of code.‚Äù
* * *

## 12. Shorter is better

Short sentences are easier to translate, for both machines and humans! Break clauses into multiple sentences.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúIf you are looking to enable triggers for the Storage Category with Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB as Providers, the CLI supports associating Lambda triggers with S3 and DynamoDB events.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúYou can enable triggers for the Storage Category with Amazon S3 & Amazon DynamoDB as Providers. Amplify supports associating Lambda triggers with S3 and DynamoDB events.‚Äù
* * *

## 13. Lead with location; end with action

When instructing a learner on how to do something, start with the location of the action they‚Äôre going to perform so they can navigate to that place, then end with the action they can then use.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúSelect **Edge optimized** in the **Endpoint Type** drop-down.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúIn the **Endpoint Type** drop-down, select **Edge optimized.‚Äù**
* * *

## 14. Use monospace fonts for code, commands, copy-ables; use bold for menus, URLs (clickable), and other UI copy

Code tags and monospace fonts are used to represent code that goes into files or CLI. UI copy, file names, URLs you can click on use **bold.** Remember: monospace is for anything that lives in or is copied to a file or a command line. Everything else is bold.

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúTo create a new file, go to ‚ÄòMenu‚Äô and click on `new file`.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn your browser, open `http://localhost:3000/` ‚Äù

‚ÄúEnter the Amplify Library for Swift GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúTo create a new file, go to **Menu > New File.‚Äù**

‚ÄúIn your browser, open **http://localhost:3000/‚Äù**

‚ÄúEnter the Amplify Library for Swift GitHub repo URL (`https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-swift`) into the search bar and hit **Enter**.‚Äù
* * *

## 15. Use carets to help users navigate menus; use ‚Äúselect‚Äù instead of ‚Äúclick‚Äù

* For instructions for navigating a menu, use carets to indicate the hierarchy of the menu items. This is concise and easy to follow.
* Tell people to ‚Äúselect‚Äù things instead of ‚Äúclick on them‚Äù. Not everyone uses a mouse‚Äîmany people tab or touch items.


### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúTo create a new file, go to ‚ÄòMenu,‚Äô select ‚ÄòArt,‚Äô and click on ‚Äònew file‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúClick on ‚Äòupload image.‚Äô‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúTo create a new file, go to **Menu > Art > New File**.‚Äù

‚ÄúSelect **upload image**.‚Äù
* * *

## 16. Bracket `<replacement text>` in codeblocks

In code blocks, refer to placeholder text with angle brackets, lowercase, with dashes. 

### Don‚Äôt

* `amplify/backend/api/~apiname~/schema.graphql`
* `amplify/backend/api/YOUR-API-NAME/schema.graphql`
* `amplify/backend/api/<YOUR_API_NAME>/schema.graphql`
* `amplify/backend/api/<your_api_name>/schema.graphql`
* `amplify/backend/api/<your api name>/schema.graphql`
* `amplify/backend/api/{yourAPIname}/schema.graphql`

### Do

**`amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql`**
* * *

## 17. Refer to Amplify files in the /amplify directory

When referring to files in the **amplify** directory, always preface with **amplify/**

### Don‚Äôt

**`backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql`**

### Do

**`amplify/backend/api/<api-name>/schema.graphql`**

* * *

## 18. Write compliant JSON: no single quotes, no comments

Conform to the [JSON standard](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). 

* Key names are enclosed in `"`
* Values are between `"` instead of `'`
* No comments

* Only JavaScript and TypeScript let you use double and single quotes interchangeably. This means that when people from other platforms copy-paste JSON from our examples, they run into errors.

### Don‚Äôt

```json
{
  // REQUIRED only for Federated Authentication - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
  identityPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab',
  // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
  region: 'XX-XXXX-X'
}
```

### Do

```json
{
  "identityPoolId": "XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab",
  "region": "XX-XXXX-X"
}
```

## 19. Prefix AWS and Amazon products when they first appear on a page

When an AWS service or product appears on the page for the first time, refer to it with the appropriate prefix, either AWS or Amazon. You can [find a full listing here.](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/)

### Don‚Äôt

‚ÄúAmplify Hosting uses S3 for file storage. Amplify Hosting also provides caching to ensure files are delivered quickly to users.‚Äù

### Do

‚ÄúAWS Amplify Hosting uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for file storage. Amplify Hosting also provides caching to ensure files are delivered quickly to users.‚Äù
* * *

## 20. Write links using markdown syntax

When editing text content in markdown files use the markdown syntax for links. We use some special linting processes that leverage markdown.

### Don't

`<a href="/some-link">Use html link tags</a>`

### Do

`\[Use mdx link syntax](/some-link)`

## 21. Use 2-space indents for code blocks

When adding code blocks and indenting encapsulated code, use 2 spaces for each indent

### Don't

```js
Amplify.configure({
    // 4-space indent
    Auth: {
        // ...
    }
});
```

### Do

```js
Amplify.configure({
  // 2-space indent
  Auth: {
    // ...
  }
});
```
