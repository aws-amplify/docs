👏 In this tutorial, you created an application that persists data both locally on the device and in the cloud. 

To begin your production application, continue to the [Project Setup](~/lib/project-setup/create-application.md) guide which will walk you through more details of setting up an Amplify application. Then, you will be ready to start exploring additional Amplify categories to add to your application:

- [Authentication](~/lib/auth/getting-started.md)
- [Storage](~/lib/storage/getting-started.md)
- [DataStore](~/lib/datastore/getting-started.md)
- [API (GraphQL)](~/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started.md)
- [API (REST)](~/lib/restapi/getting-started.md)
- [Analytics](~/lib/analytics/getting-started.md)
- [Predictions](~/lib/predictions/getting-started.md)
