Welcome! 🎸 <br/>

The open-source Amplify Framework provides a set of libraries, UI components, and a command line interface to build fullstack iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps. The Amplify CLI allows you to configure all the services needed to power your backend through a simple command line interface. The Amplify libraries makes it easy to integrate your app code with a backend backend using declarative interfaces and simple UI components. Amplify has the following products:

- Amplify Libraries - Use case-centric open source libraries in the Amplify Framework to build cloud powered mobile and web apps.
- Amplify CLI - Open source toolchain in the Amplify Framework to create, integrate, and manage the backend of your app.
- Amplify UI component libraries for React, React Native, Angular, Ionic and Vue.
- Amplify Console (accessible in the AWS Console) is an AWS service that provides a git-based workflow for continuous deployment and hosting of fullstack web apps. You can also use the Console to access cloud resources created by the Amplify CLI.
