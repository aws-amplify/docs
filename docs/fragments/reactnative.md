## What we'll build

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your React Native app. You will create a “Todo app” with a GraphQL API and to store and retrieve items in a cloud database. In addition, we'll demonstrate how to authenticate users, communicate with our API, and set up continuous deployment and hosting.
