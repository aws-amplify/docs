title: Reuse code & assets using layers
description: Use Amplify CLI's Lambda layer capability to reuse code & assets across functions.
---

Lambda layers allow you to pull common code & assets for your Lambda function into a centralized location. With Lambda layers you can:

1. _*Re-use your code & assets*_: Your Lambda functions can leverage these layers to reuse shared code & assets across functions
2. _*Speed up function deployments*_: Iterating on your Lambda function will be significantly faster because it can be independently updated from the layer which usually contains the bulk of large static content

> **Known limitation**: Functions using a layer can't be mocked locally using `amplify mock`. We recommend you to create a dev environment and test the functions inside the AWS Lambda console.

The general workflow breaks down into the following steps:

1. Create a Lambda layer
2. Add shared code & assets to the layer
3. Add the Lambda layer to a function
4. Deploy the layer & function

## Create a Lambda Layer

To create a layer, run the following command within your Amplify project:

```bash
amplify add function
```

Select `Lambda layer` as the capability to add

```console
? Select which capability you want to add:
> Lambda layer (shared code & resource used across functions)
```

```console
? Provide a name for your Lambda layer: (layer-name)
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: (Use arrow keys)
❯ NodeJS
  Python
```

Next, you'll be guided through a workflow to provide a **layer name**, and select a **supported runtime**. Currently Amplify CLI provides NodeJS or Python runtime support for layers.

```console
? The current AWS account will always have access to this layer.
  Optionally, configure who else can access this layer. (Hit <Enter> to skip)
◯ Specific AWS accounts
◯ Specific AWS organization
◯ Public (everyone on AWS can use this layer)
```

After that, you'll be asked to configure your **layer's permission**.

The **current AWS account will always have access to this layer**.
In addition, the customer can configure access for:

- **Specific AWS accounts**: provide a comma-separated list of AWS Account IDs to provide access to them.
- **Specific AWS organizations**: provide a comma-separated list of AWS Organization IDs to provide access to them. *AWS Organization IDs start with `o-`.*
- **Public**: make this layer available for everyone AWS. Anyone in AWS can reference this layer using its ARN.

```console
Next steps:
Move your libraries to the following folder:
[NodeJS]: amplify/backend/function/<lambda-layer-name>/lib/nodejs

Include any files you want to share across runtimes in this folder:
amplify/backend/function/<lambda-layer-name>/opt

"amplify function update <function-name>" - configure a function with this Lambda layer
"amplify push" - builds all of your local backend resources and provisions them in the cloud
```

Your Lambda layer is ready to use after the permissions are set up.

## Add shared code & assets

Now that your layer is set up, you'll see a new folder with the `layer-name` added to `amplify/backend/function/`. The respective runtime's folder structure is autogenerated.

### Add shared code

<amplify-block-switcher>

<amplify-block name="NodeJS">

A `nodejs` folder is auto-generated for you. In there you'll find an empty `package.json` file and a `node_modules` folder. If you want to offload other node_modules you can either:

1. `cd` into the `nodejs` folder and add the dependencies into the `package.json` file, or
2. move all your existing function's `node_modules` content into the layer's `node_modules` folder

Any dependency listed within the layer's `package.json` file will be installed and packaged during `amplify push`.

Any node module that is in the layer's `node_modules` folder can be accessed from the function as if the node module is in the function's `node_modules` folder. 


*In order to take advantage of Lambda layer's for your NodeJS function, you don't even need to update your function's code!*

</amplify-block>

<amplify-block name="Python">

A `python` folder is auto-generated for you. In there you'll find an empty `Pipfile` file. Any packages listed within the layer's `Pipfile` file will be installed and packaged during `amplify push`. You can `import` these packages from within your Python function just like any other package within your Python function.

</amplify-block>

</amplify-block-switcher>

### Add shared assets

Any assets like large images or other files that you want to share across various functions can be placed in the `amplify/backend/function/<layer-name>/opt/` folder. Your function's code can import any assets by looking for files in the `/opt/` path.

### Lambda layer versions

Every time `amplify push` or `amplify update function` is run, Amplify CLI checks if a layer's content has changed and automatically creates a new *layer version*. Layer versions are immutable and functions always use a specific layer version. 

In order to speed up deployments when vast amount of node_modules exist, Amplify CLI scans only for changes within each module's `package.json` file. If you don't see Amplify CLI detect your latest changes, verify that at least of your node module's `package.json` content has changed.

## Add a layer to a function

You can either create a new function and add Lambda layers by running `amplify add function` or add layers to an existing function using `amplify update function`. Select `Lambda function` when prompted and you'll be presented the following question during the guided flow:

```console
...
? Do you want to enable Lambda layers for this function? Yes
? Provide existing layers or select layers in this project to access from this function (pick up to 5):
 ◯ Provide existing Lambda layer ARNs
❯◉ myamplifylayer1
 ◯ myamplifylayer2
```

You can either add an existing layer in AWS by referencing its ARN or select a layer from your Amplify project that's listed below.

```console
? Select a version for myamplifylayer1:
❯ Always choose latest version
  2: Updated layer version 2021-06-08T05:33:42.651Z
  1: Updated layer version 2021-06-08T05:30:43.101Z
```

When adding a layer from your Amplify project, you'll also be able to select a specific layer version or always choose the latest layer version. The largest layer version number represents the most recent changes.

```console
? Modify the layer order:
(Layers with conflicting files will overwrite contents of layers earlier in the list):
- layer2
- layer3
- layer6
- <ARN1>
- <ARN2>
```

Given that layers can have overlapping contents, the order of the layer matters. You can adjust the layer's order if needed in the next step.

Now, you've successfully added a layer to your function.

## Deploy Lambda layers & functions with Lambda layers

Once you're ready with your changes in your layer and functions, you can deploy them by running `amplify push`.

If a layer’s content has been updated and it has permissions associated, Amplify CLI will prompt you whether you want to carry the permissions forward to a newer version.

```console
Content changes in Lambda layers detected.
Suggested configuration for new layer versions:

myamplifylayer1
  - Description: Updated layer version  2021-06-08T05:33:42.651Z

? Accept the suggested layer version configurations? (Y/n)
```

During `amplify push`, you get to modify the layer version description. By default, Amplify CLI will populate the description as `Updated layer version <timestamp>`.

## Update layer content

Any file changes within a layer's folder are automatically tracked by Amplify CLI. If there are changes available, the Amplify CLI will create a new layer version with the changes.

## Update layer settings

You can update any of the layer's settings like its name, runtimes, or permissions by running `amplify update function` and selecting `Lambda layer`.

Next, you'll be prompted to select the layer for which you want to update the settings for.

## Remove a layer

To remove a Lambda layer, run the `amplify function remove` command and select `Lambda layers`. Next, you'll be prompted to select which layer to remove. You can delete specific layer versions or all of them.

> Warning: When you delete a layer, you can no longer configure functions to use it. However, any function that already uses the layer continues to have access to it.

```console
? Choose the resource you would want to remove <lambda-layer-name> (layer)
When you delete a layer version, you can no longer configure functions to use it.
However, any function that already uses the layer version continues to have access to it.
? Choose the Layer versions you want to remove.
❯◯ 1: Updated layer version 2021-06-08T05:30:43.101Z
 ◯ 2: Updated layer version 2021-06-08T05:33:42.651Z
? Are you sure you want to delete the resource? This action deletes all files related to this resource from the backend directory. (Y/n)
```
