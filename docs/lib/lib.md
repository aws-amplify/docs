The Amplify open-source client libraries provide use-case centric, opinionated, declarative, and easy-to-use interfaces across different categories of cloud powered operations enabling mobile and web developers to easily interact with their backends. These libraries are powered by the AWS cloud and offer a pluggable model which can be extended to use other providers. The libraries can be used with both new backends created using the Amplify CLI and/or existing backend resources that were not created using the Amplify CLI.
