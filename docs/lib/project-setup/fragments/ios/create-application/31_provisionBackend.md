To add these configuration files to your project, **open finder within your project** and **drag both `amplifyconfiguration.json` and `awsconfiguration.json` to the Xcode window**, under your project's folder as seen in this screenshot:

* Enable **Copy items if needed** if not already enabled
* For “Added folders”, have **Create groups** selected.
* For “Add to targets”, make sure the app target (**MyAmplifyApp**) is checked.

Click **Finish** to add these files to your project as shown in this screenshot:

Now you can build (`Cmd+b`) and run (`Cmd+r`) your application.
