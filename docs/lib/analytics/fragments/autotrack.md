The Amplify analytics plugin records when an application opens and closes. This session information can be viewed either from your local computer's terminal or the AWS Console for Pinpoint.

To view this from the Console:

```sh
amplify console
```

1. Navigate to the *Analytics* tab, and then choose *View in Pinpoint*.
2. On the Pinpoint Console under Analytics, choose *Events*. 
3. Enable filters, you can select `Session Start` and `Session Stop` events to filter on session events.
