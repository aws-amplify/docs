AWS Amplify Push Notifications module allows you to integrate push notifications in your app with Amazon Pinpoint targeting and campaign management support.

Push Notifications are currently supported only for *React Native*. For handling Web Push Notification with Service Workers, visit our [Service Workers Guide](/lib/utilities/serviceworker#handling-a-push-notification).


This guide provides a step-by-step introduction to start working with push notifications in React Native with Amazon Pinpoint. Amazon Pinpoint helps you to monitor your app's usage, create messaging campaigns targeted to specific user segments or demographics, and collect interaction metrics with push notifications. 

Ensure you have [installed and configured the Amplify CLI and library](/start/getting-started/installation).
