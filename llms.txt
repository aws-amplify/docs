- [Configure custom identity and group claims - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/configure-custom-identity-and-group-claim/): Amplify Data allows you to configure custom identity and group claims instead of using the default Cognito claims, which can be useful if you want to populate claims from an external source like a database or 3rd party auth provider. The example shows how to check the `user_id` identity claim and the `user_groups` group claim that could come from a custom pre token generation Lambda trigger. Defining these custom claims provides more flexibility in authorization rules. AWS Amplify Documentation
- [Signed-in user data access - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/signed-in-user-data-access/): The `private` authorization strategy restricts record access to only signed-in users authenticated through IAM, Cognito, or OpenID Connect, applying the authorization rule to all users.

- [Multi-user data access - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/multi-user-data-access/): The `ownersDefinedIn` rule grants a set of users access to a record by automatically creating an `owners` field to store the allowed record owners. You can override the default owners field name by specifying `inField` with the desired field name to store the owner information. You can dynamically manage which users can access a record by updating the owner field. AWS Amplify Documentation
- [Per-user/per-owner data access - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/per-user-per-owner-data-access/): The owner authorization strategy restricts operations on a record to only the record's owner. When configured, the owner field (default `owner`) will automatically be added and populated with the identity of the created user. The API will authorize against the `owner` field to allow or deny operations. AWS Amplify Documentation
- [Public data access - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/public-data-access/): The public authorization strategy grants everyone access to the API, which is protected behind the scenes with an API key. You can also override the authorization provider to use an unauthenticated IAM role from Cognito instead of an API key for public access. AWS Amplify Documentation
- [Use OpenID Connect as an authorization provider - Flutter - AWS Amplify Gen 2 Documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/build-a-backend/data/customize-authz/using-oidc-authorization-provider/): Use OpenID Connect with `private`, `owner`, and `group` authorization strategies.
